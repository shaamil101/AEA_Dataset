In these areas, the school day is often short, attendance is sporadic, and enrollment by school-age children is not universal. The EpC is a half-day after-school program with monthly ""school for parents"" meetings. The EpC program targets at-risk children of primary school age that have not passed 3rd grade at the time of eligibility and provides them with enrichment activities that include academic instruction, self-esteem-building, physical play, and other mechanisms to strengthen children's connection to formal school.

This study is a randomised control trial (RCT) evaluation of a preventative programme which aims to improve school readiness and life outcomes of socioeconomically disadvantaged children. The programme is operating in several disadvantaged communities in Dublin with above national average rates of unemployment, early school leavers, lone parent households and social housing.  The Preparing for Life (PFL) programme, which began in 2008, works with families from pregnancy until school entry in order to promote positive child development through improved parental behaviour and social support.

The programme is being evaluated using a mixed methods approach, incorporating a longitudinal experimental design and implementation analysis. The experimental component involves the random allocation of participants from the PFL communities to either the low or high treatment group for the duration of the programme. 

Who can participate? 
All pregnant women from the target communities in Dublin were eligible to participate. 233 pregnant were recruited into the PFL Programme between 2008 and 2010. Randomisation resulted in 115 participants assigned to the high treatment group and 118 participants assigned to the low treatment group. In addition, 99 pregnant women were recruited into a comparison group from comparable community. The population based recruitment rate was 52%.

What does the study involve? 
Preparing for Life provides a range of supports to participating families from pregnancy until school entry. The programme targets a range of child outcomes which are related to school readiness, including cognitive development, physical health and motor skills, socio-emotional development, behavioural skills, language development and emergent literacy. 

On recruitment during pregnancy, participants are randomly assigned to either a low treatment group or a high treatment group. Both the high and low treatment groups receive €100 worth of developmental toys annually and facilitated access to one year of high quality preschool.  In addition, the high treatment group receive two additional supports that are not available to the low treatment group. First, participants in the high treatment group receive a home-visiting mentoring support service. The aim of the home visits is to support and help the parents with key parenting issues. Secondly, participants in the high treatment group also participate in group parent training using the Triple P Positive Parenting Programme which aims to improve positive parenting in a group-based setting for eight consecutive weeks. 

The evaluation collects data from all three groups (high treatment, low treatment, comparison group) at baseline during pregnancy (t0), and when the child is six months (t1), 12 months (t2), 18 months (t3), 24 months (t4), three years (t5), and four years old (t6). A comprehensive set of data are collected at each point. At each time point, we compare the outcomes of the high treatment group, low treatment and comparison groups.

To determine if the effects of the programme are sustained later in childhood, data collected from high and low treatment groups at 7-11 years (age 9 on average are collected and compared as part of a follow-up study

What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? 
If the programme is effective, families in the high treatment group may benefit from the programme by gaining greater parenting knowledge and skills; and their children will be better prepared for school.

Risks of participation are few.  The main risk is that some study questions are of a personal nature and may cause participant discomfort or stress.  Potential participants are informed as part of the consent process that participation is voluntary and that they can withdraw from the study or decline to answer any question at any time without penalty.

Where is the study run from? 
The Evaluation of PFL is housed at the Geary Institute at University College Dublin in Dublin Ireland.

When is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? 
Recruitment took place from 2008 to 2010.  The evaluation continues until all children are 4 years of age, in March 2015.

A follow-up study from January 2019 to September 2019 examines the impact of receiving the PFL programme between the ages of 0 and 5 on children's outcomes later in childhood (approximately age 9).

Who is funding the study? 
The evaluation of the Preparing for Life programme is funded by the Northside Partnership through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and The Atlantic Philanthropies.

The follow-up study at ~age 9 is funded by the Northside Partnership

","Abstract: Objectives
Pregnancy, labour, and delivery involve risk for mothers and infants. This study tested the effectiveness of a home-based programme to improve perinatal outcomes among socially disadvantaged women. The hypothesis was that the intervention group who received education and support during pregnancy would have better perinatal outcomes than the control group.

Study design
This is a randomised controlled trial. Pregnant women from a disadvantaged community in Dublin, Ireland were eligible for participation in Preparing for Life, a home visiting early intervention programme. 233 participants were recruited and assigned to an intervention (n = 115) and control (n = 118) group using an unconditional probability randomisation strategy. Maternity hospital records were available for 206 participants (nintervention = 106; ncontrol = 100). Consent to access records was not provided by 9 participants, records were missing for 17 participants and 1 record was excluded due to miscarriage. The intervention group were prescribed an average of ten prenatal home visits from a trained mentor. Mentors provided information on healthy prenatal behaviours and the birthing experience using tip sheets and social support. The control group received care as usual including the opportunity to attend standard antenatal classes. The outcomes included neonatal (Apgar scores, birth weight, gestational age and prematurity) and maternal (labour onset method and delivery method) outcomes. Statistical analyses were conducted using t -tests, tests of proportions, regression, logistic regression and permutation testing.

Results
There were no differences on any of the neonatal outcomes or the majority of the maternal outcomes. Two secondary results were found such that there was an increase in the rate of spontaneous onset of labour in the intervention group compared to the control group (69.8% v 58.0%; OR 1.67, 95% CI = 0.94, 2.97; p < 0.05) and there was a reduction in caesarean section rates in the intervention group compared to the control group (15.1% v 25.0%; OR 0.53, 95% CI = 0.27, 1.07; p < 0.05).

Conclusions
This prenatal home visiting programme had no impact on neonatal outcomes, yet there was suggestive evidence that it prepared women for birth, and potentially led to increased spontaneous onset of labour and reduced caesarean section. Further studies are required to test these observation generating hypotheses.

Abstract: This study examined the factors influencing participant engagement in a home visiting program. Specifically, it explored the relationship between dosage and the constituent components of psychological resources: mental health, mastery, and cognitive resources. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted utilising implementation data from a sample (n = 95) of participants in an Irish home visiting program. Psychological resources significantly predicted dosage, yet an investigation of each component found that only cognitive resources remained significant. Furthermore, when considering types of cognitive resources, verbal ability was found to significantly predict the number of home visits but not the average duration of visits. Conversely, perceptual reasoning was found to predict the average duration of home visits but not the number of home visits. These results suggest that cognitive resources may be the driving component behind previous findings that link psychological resources and level of dosage in home visiting programs. Practice and policy implications are explored.

Abstract: This article investigates the impact of an early intervention program, which experimentally modifies the parenting and home environment of disadvantaged families, on child physical health in the first 3 years of life. We recruited and randomized 233 (115 intervention, 118 control) pregnant women from a socioeconomically disadvantaged community in Dublin, Ireland into an intervention or control group. The treatment includes regular home visits commencing antenatally and an additional parenting course commencing at 2 years. Maternal reports of child health are assessed at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. Treatment effects are estimated using permutation testing to account for small sample size, inverse probability weighting to account for differential attrition, and both the stepdown procedure and an indices approach to account for multiple hypothesis testing. Following adjustment for multiple testing and attrition, we observe a positive and statistically significant main treatment effect for wheezing/asthma. The intervention group are 15.5 percentage points (pp) less likely to require medical attention for wheezing/asthma compared to the control group. Subgroup analysis reveals more statistically significant adjusted treatment effects for boys than girls regarding fewer health problems (d = 0.63), accidents (23.9 pp), and chest infections (22.8–37.9 pp). Our results suggest that a community-based home visiting program may have favorable impacts on early health conditions.

Abstract: This study examined the impact of a targeted Irish early intervention program on children’s emotional and behavioral development using multiple methods to test the robustness of the results. Data on 164 Preparing for Life participants who were randomly assigned into an intervention group, involving home visits from pregnancy onwards, or a control group, was used to test the impact of the intervention on Child Behavior Checklist scores at 24-months. Using inverse probability weighting to account for differential attrition, permutation testing to address small sample size, and quantile regression to characterize the distributional impact of the intervention, we found that the few treatment effects were largely concentrated among boys most at risk of developing emotional and behavioral problems. The average treatment effect identified a 13% reduction in the likelihood of falling into the borderline clinical threshold for Total Problems. The interaction and subgroup analysis found that this main effect was driven by boys. The distributional analysis identified a 10-point reduction in the Externalizing Problems score for boys at the 90th percentile. No effects were observed for girls or for the continuous measures of Total, Internalizing, and Externalizing problems. These findings suggest that the impact of this prenatally commencing home visiting program may be limited to boys experiencing the most difficulties. Further adoption of the statistical methods applied here may help to improve the internal validity of randomized controlled trials and contribute to the field of evaluation science more generally.

Abstract: Children from economically disadvantaged communities frequently lack the socio-emotional, cognitive and behavioural skills needed for successful early school adjustment. Assessments of early school experience often rely on parent and teacher perspectives, yet children’s views are essential to design effective, resilience-promoting school ecologies. This mixed methods study explored children’s appraisals of potential stressors in the first school year with 25 children from a disadvantaged suburban community in Ireland. School scenarios were presented pictorially (Pictorial Measure of School Stress and Wellbeing, or PMSSW), to elicit children’s perspectives on social ecological factors that enable or constrain resilience. Salient positive factors included resource provision, such as food, toys and books; school activities and routines, including play; and relationships with teachers. Negative factors included bullying; difficulties engaging with peers; and using the toilet. Drawing on these factors, we indicate how school psychologists can develop resilience-fostering educational environments for children in vulnerable communities.

Abstract: Early home visiting intervention programmes have been associated with greater familial well-being, yet their success depends on attaining engagement from the outset. Implementation practices, central to positive programme outcomes, rely on a strong relationship between programme providers and families. The present study explored the role of this relationship in the implementation of an Irish early childhood intervention. A randomised controlled trial of the Preparing for Life (PFL) programme was conducted in disadvantaged Dublin communities involving 233 participants recruited during pregnancy and assigned to a high or low intervention group. High intervention involved regular home visits from a trained home visitor providing parenting support and information. This study presents qualitative findings from focus groups with high intervention parents (n=11) and interviews with home visitors (n=5) conducted when participating children were on average 5 months old. Though early engagement challenges were identified, in time parents noted the strengthening parent-home visitor relationship. Findings highlight the importance of programme flexibility and parent-home visitor rapport to programme engagement. Wellbeing did not arise as a salient theme, though it may emerge as a longer-term programme outcome. These findings reveal key aspects of early implementation which may contribute to the ultimate success of the programme.

Abstract: Children’s use of the toilet at school, although rarely explored, is an important facet of school experience with consequences for physical and psychological health. A mixed methods study investigated views of 25 children (4–5 years) regarding potential stressors in the first school year, including views of toileting, in Dublin, Ireland. Despite very positive responses to school, most responses to toileting (15 of 25) were mixed or negative. Although some liked to go, or noted the toilets were clean, most indicated delayed toilet use (“bursting” to go) and ambivalent or negative experiences such as fear of not identifying the right toilet, fear of being alone, lack of privacy, and potential bullying. Many children did not expect to receive help from the teacher. As delaying toilet use can have lasting health consequences, teacher–nurse collaboration could be used to develop whole-school policies to support children’s early adjustment in this sensitive area of functioning.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate the impact of an early intervention programme, Preparing for Life, on dietary intake between 12 and 36 months of age, and the mediating role played by diet on cognitive functioning.

Design
A randomised controlled trial evaluation of a community-based home visiting programme. The intervention involved biweekly visits from mentors from pregnancy until age 5 years and parent training at age 2 years. Dietary intake was assessed at 12, 18, 24 and 36 months using an FFQ to calculate the proportion meeting dietary recommendations. Cognitive functioning was measured at 24 and 36 months. Treatment effects were estimated using conventional χ 2 tests, permutation testing, inverse probability weighting and the stepdown procedure. Mediation analysis examined the indirect effect of the intervention on cognitive functioning via its effect on dietary intake.

Setting
Socio-economically disadvantaged communities in Dublin, Republic of Ireland.

Subjects
Pregnant women (n 233) were assigned to the intervention (n 115) or control (n 118) group using an unconditional probability randomisation strategy.

Positive treatment effects were observed for meeting dietary recommendations for protein foods at 24 (OR=2·52) and 36 (OR=2·42) months, and all food groups at 24 (OR=3·92) months. There were no effects on grain, dairy, fruit and vegetable, or fatty/sugary food recommendations in most models. The conventional and more novel methods yielded similar results. Mediation analysis indicated that 13 % of the intervention’s effect on cognitive functioning was mediated by 36-month protein food consumption.

Conclusions
The study demonstrates some potential to alter early childhood dietary patterns through community-based intervention programmes.

Abstract: This paper presents evidence on early skill formation and parental investment using an experimentally designed, home visiting program targeting disadvantaged Irish families. Program effects from pregnancy to 18 months are estimated using measures of parenting and child cognitive, noncognitive and physical development. Permutation testing, a stepdown procedure, and inverse probability weighting are applied to account for small sample size, multiple hypothesis testing, and attrition. The program's impact is concentrated on parental behaviors and the home environment with small to moderate effect sizes found. Deficits in parenting skills can be offset within a relatively short timeframe, yet continued investment may be required to observe child effects.

Abstract: Research shows that children facing socioeconomic risk often have poorer skills at school entry, greater difficulty adjusting to school, more negative school experiences, and lower scholastic achievement, relative to their peers. However, the promotion of positive early school experiences is constrained by a lack of insight into disadvantaged children’s own perspectives. To address this gap, this study interviewed 26 children living in a disadvantaged community in Ireland who had recently commenced formal schooling. Interviews included semi-structured questions and a draw-and-talk activity. Interview questions and drawings were analysed using the principles of thematic analysis and content analysis respectively, and the findings were integrated to identify four overarching themes. These included children’s sense of self in school, what happens in school, the importance of peer relationships, and children’s lives around school. The results provide reflection points for research and practice, such as the promotion of positive peer experiences and strong family–school connections.

Abstract: Studies support cognitive and social domains of development as entwined in childhood, however, there is a paucity of investigation into the nature of the mother–child relationship within an interdependence framework. Furthermore, the focus on these processes within families from impoverished communities using frequent assessments in early childhood has been limited. Our objectives were to identify (1) the directional associations between toddler’s communication ability and social competence, (2) to establish whether the association between toddler’s communication ability and social competence is mediated by maternal warmth, and (3) to establish support for transactional models between toddlers’ outcomes and maternal warmth in disadvantaged communities in Ireland. Participants included 173 toddlers and their families enrolled in a prenatally commencing prevention programme. Toddler’s communication and social competence were assessed at 12, 18, 24 and 36 months and maternal warmth at 6 and 24 months. Cross-lagged models were estimated examining multiple paths of associations simultaneously. Direct and indirect paths of maternal warmth were also examined. Bi-directional associations were found between communication ability and social competence from 12 to 24 months but not thereafter. Maternal warmth did not significantly mediate these associations, however, support of a transactional model was found with social competence. The results support early positive associations between better communication ability and social competence in the first 2 years, however, they suggest that these associations are no longer present by the third year. The role of maternal warmth in fostering social competencies is important for toddlers and equally important is toddler’s level of social competence in eliciting increased maternal warmth.

Abstract: Objective
This study estimates the effect of a targeted early childhood intervention program on global and experienced measures of maternal well-being utilizing a randomized controlled trial design. The primary aim of the intervention is to improve children’s school readiness skills by working directly with parents to improve their knowledge of child development and parenting behavior. One potential externality of the program is well-being benefits for parents given its direct focus on improving parental coping, self-efficacy, and problem solving skills, as well as generating an indirect effect on parental well-being by targeting child developmental problems.

Methods
Participants from a socio-economically disadvantaged community are randomly assigned during pregnancy to an intensive 5-year home visiting parenting program or a control group. We estimate and compare treatment effects on multiple measures of global and experienced well-being using permutation testing to account for small sample size and a stepdown procedure to account for multiple testing.

Results
The intervention has no impact on global well-being as measured by life satisfaction and parenting stress or experienced negative affect using episodic reports derived from the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM). Treatment effects are observed on measures of experienced positive affect derived from the DRM and a measure of mood yesterday.

Conclusion
The limited treatment effects suggest that early intervention programs may produce some improvements in experienced positive well-being, but no effects on negative aspects of well-being. Different findings across measures may result as experienced measures of well-being avoid the cognitive biases that impinge upon global assessments.

Abstract: Preparing for Life (PFL) is a prevention and early intervention programme which aims to improve the life outcomes of disadvantaged children in Dublin, Ireland. PFL was designed and implemented by the Northside Partnership and was subject to an extensive evaluation conducted by the UCD Geary Institute for Public Policy between 2008 and 2015 using a randomised control trial design. The evaluation found that the PFL programme had a significant impact on children’s skills by raising cognitive ability, reducing behavioural problems, and improving health. Please see Doyle (2017) and Doyle and PFL Evaluation Team (2016) for a description of the final results. The programme was one of 52 programmes funded by The Atlantic Philanthropies and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs as part of the Prevention and Early Intervention Initiative. In mid-2017 almost all the quantitative data collected as part of the PFL evaluation were placed in the Irish Social Science Data Archive (ISSDA). The decision to archive the data was made prospectively during the design of the study. The aim of this article is to describe the motivation for archiving the PFL data and the processes involved in prospectively designing, collecting, and storing data which was destined for a national archive.

Abstract: Using a randomized experiment, this study investigates the impact of sustained investment in parenting, from pregnancy until age five, in the context of extensive welfare provision. Providing the Preparing for Life program, incorporating home visiting, group parenting, and baby massage, to disadvantaged Irish families raises children’s cognitive and socio-emotional/behavioral scores by two-thirds and one-quarter of a standard deviation respectively by school entry. There are few differential effects by gender and stronger gains for firstborns. The results also suggest that socioeconomic gaps in children’s skills are narrowed. Analyses account for small sample size, differential attrition, multiple testing, contamination, and performance bias.

Abstract: This study uses data from an evaluation of an early intervention programme, Preparing for Life, to estimate the impact of book gifting on shared reading during infancy and the association between reading and later development. Participants were randomised during pregnancy to a high intensity intervention group, receiving mentoring and book packs (n = 78), and a low intensity intervention group, receiving book packs only (n = 80). A no-intervention comparison group were allocated using non-random assignment (n = 78). At 6 and 12 months both the high and low intensity groups were more likely to read to their infant a few times per week or daily than the comparison group. The intervention groups did not differ statistically on reading frequency. Daily reading at 6 months predicted higher vocabulary comprehension and production, cognition, and socioemotional competence at 12 months. Book gifting may offer an efficient means of reading promotion in disadvantaged communities.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the developmental impact of a prenatal–to–age-5 multicomponent early intervention program targeting families living in low socioeconomic conditions.

METHODS: Pregnant women from a disadvantaged Irish community were randomly assigned into a treatment group (home visits, baby massage, and parenting program; n = 115) or control group (n = 118). Children’s behavioral problems (externalizing, internalizing), cognitive skills (general, vocabulary), and health service use (number of health clinic visits), were regularly assessed (6 months to 4 years of age). Children’s developmental trajectories were modeled by using latent class growth analyses to test whether certain subgroups benefited more than others.

RESULTS: High and low developmental trajectories were identified for each outcome. Treated children were more likely to follow the high-level trajectory for cognition (odds ratio = 2.89; 95% confidence interval = 1.55–5.50) and vocabulary skills (odds ratio = 2.02; 95% confidence interval = 1.08–3.82). There were no differences by treatment condition in the risk of belonging to a high externalizing or high health clinic visit trajectory. However, within the high externalizing trajectory, treated children had lower scores than controls (Hedges’ g range (2–4 years) = 0.45–0.58; P < .05) and, within the high health clinic visit trajectory, only children in the control group experienced an increasing number of visits.

CONCLUSIONS: This program revealed moderate positive impacts on trajectories of cognitive development and number of health clinic visits for all children, whereas positive impacts on externalizing behavior problems were restricted to children with the most severe problems.

Abstract: Many early intervention studies experience a dissolution of treatment effects in the aftermath of the intervention. Using a randomized trial, this paper examines the impact of Preparing for Life, a pregnancy to age five home visiting and parenting program, on outcomes in middle childhood. I find significant treatment effects on cognitive skills (0.55SD) and school achievement tests (0.30-0.54SD) at age nine. There is no impact on socio-emotional skills and there is little evidence of treatment heterogeneity by gender, birth order, or distribution of ability. The effects are mainly driven by improvements in early parental beliefs.

Abstract: Evidence on the impact of early intervention on childhood health is inconsistent. Using a randomized controlled trial, we examine the impact of an Irish early intervention program on the development of health capital in the first five years of life. The treatment provides intensive parenting supports including home visits and parenting classes from pregnancy until school entry. Modest effects by age four are found, mainly driven by reduced hospital attendances attributed to improved earlier health. In sum, the program has limited effects on children’s health capital in the short-run despite demonstrating large effects on other dimensions of human capital.

","Abstract: Abstract: This paper examines whether social ties impact informal insurance in the presence of asymmetric information. Using games with residents of informal settlements in Kenya, I vary the observability of task completion and partners. While individuals are less likely to make transfers as a result of imperfect monitoring, socially close individuals are 30% more likely to make transfers. As a result, socially close individuals are 47% more likely to make transfers than socially distant individuals when task completion cannot be observed. I then explore the mechanisms by which social connections influence risk sharing. I find evidence that social connections increase participants’ motivation to work only when task completion cannot be observed, potentially due to social collateral and/or intrinsic motivation.

We offer households a range of incentivized choices between donations to religious organizations and other financial options. We implement treatments including increasing the perceived risk of life accidents and the provision of free insurance to observe the effect on the demand for religious giving.

","Abstract: This paper provides experimental support for the hypothesis that insurance can be a motive for religious donations. We randomize enrollment of members of a Pentecostal church in Ghana into a commercial funeral insurance policy. Then church members allocate money between themselves and a set of religious goods in a series of dictator games with significant stakes. Members enrolled in insurance give significantly less money to their own church compared to members that only receive information about the insurance. Enrollment also reduces giving towards other spiritual goods. We set up a model exploring different channels of religiously based insurance. The implications of the model and the results from the dictator games suggest that adherents perceive the church as a source of insurance and that this insurance is derived from beliefs in an interventionist God. Survey results suggest that material insurance from the church community is also important and we hypothesize that these two insurance channels exist in parallel.

Is female empowerment always good for child welfare? ,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/770,9/27/24,9/27/24 9:31,7/12/15,AEARCTR-0000770,10.1257/rct.770-2.3,Charlotte Ringdal charlotte.ringdal@nhh.no,completed,7/13/15,8/14/15,"[""education"", ""Female empowerment"", ""household bargaining""]","Tanzania, United Republic of (Dar es Salaam)",Ingrid Sjursen (ingrid.sjursen@cmi.no) Norwegian School of Economics,,,"Female empowerment and child welfare are important issues in today's development policies. For example, in 2009-10, 31\% of total bilateral aid by the OECD Development Assistance Committee's members were in support of gender equality, and approximately 10\% were in support of education (OECD, 2012). The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize 2014 to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzay ""…for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education"" also emphasizes the importance of these two issues. It is generally assumed that by targeting women, their children will benefit. However, the evidence in the literature is mixed. In this project, we want to contribute to the literature by studying whether women invest more in their children than men do and what the potential reasons for this might be.

The research questions are the following:
1. Is child welfare influenced by whether additional resources to the household are allocated to women or men?
2. What are the underlying mechanisms determining resources spent on children in the household?

The results from the study will provide insights on both research questions and inform the development policy debate about how to strengthen child welfare. They will also contribute to the economic theoretical literature on household models.

Concerning the first research question, many studies have shown that there is a relationship between gender and household expenditures. To illustrate, in Kenya and Malawi, Kennedy and Peters (1992) find that female-headed households spend a larger share of total income on food and a smaller share on alcohol compared to male-headed households. Similarly, Hoddinott and Haddad (1995) use data from Côte d'Ivoire and find that when the female income share in the household is increased, the share of household income spent on food increases, and the share spent on alcohol and cigarettes decreases.

The assumption that women spend more resources on their children than men leads us to the second research question: What are the mechanisms determining the amount of resources spent on children? First, women and men may have different preferences. If women assign a higher weight to children's welfare in their utility function, they will allocate more resources to their children than men. Similarly, if women are more patient than men are, they will be more willing to invest in their children as this investment yields a long-term return. On the other hand, if women are more risk averse than men, they will be less willing to invest in their children than men as this investment is risky. Second, the difference might be due to bargaining power. Assume that women and men care equally much about their children. In a situation where the men have all the bargaining power and hence make all the decisions, they have to bear all the costs of investing in their children, whereas both adults in the household benefit. Increasing female bargaining power implies that the cost of investing in the child is split between the two adults, and the benefit remains the same for both. In this case, investment in children would increase (Basu, 2006). 

The theoretical framework of this project derives from household models. In the literature, household models are divided into two categories; unitary and non-unitary household models. In unitary household models, the household is considered as one unit maximizing a single utility function (Lundberg and Pollak, 1996. As this model has several limitations, we will focus on non-unitary household models. In particular, one cooperative model and one non-cooperative model. The cooperative model we use is the collective household model developed by Chiappori (1992) and Browning and Chiappori (1998). This approach relies on two assumptions; there exists a stable decision process  in the household and this process leads to Pareto-efficient outcomes (Browning, Chiappori and Weiss, 2014). By using this framework, Basu (2006) finds that children in a household is less likely to work if the power structure is balanced. The non-cooperative household model used in this project is developed by Browning and Lechene (2001). In this approach, agents chose their strategies simultaneously and independently. Each individual act as an independent agent conditional on the action of the other. In other words, the individual maximizes his or her utility subject to his or her budget constraint taking into account the actions of his or her spouse. The solutions need not be Pareto efficient (in the sense that it may be possible to improve the utility of one of the spouses without reducing the utility of the other spouse). In this case, going from a situation in which the woman has no bargaining power to a situation in which the woman has some bargaining power, will decrease investments in children.

To answer the research questions, we have designed a lab experiment to be conducted in the field in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We have invited married couples with at least one child of primary school age to the lab in July and August 2015. The experiment will consist of three parts. In the first part we elicit time and risk preferences (incentivized choices) to study whether men and women have different preferences for investing in children. In the second part of the experiment, the participant will make an incentivized distributive choice. The choice they make is an allocation between themself, their spouse and their child (1/3 of participants make this decision on their own, 1/3 bargain over the decision with their spouse and 1/3 simply observes their spouse's choice). The idea here is to experimentally vary female bargaining power to investigate whether an increase in female bargaining power causally changes how much is invested in the child. In the third part of the experiment, the participants will answer four non-incentivized questions about the decision-making in their household. These questions are intended to measure bargaining power within the household. In addition, before starting the experiment, the participants will answer a set of standard background questions.",,,,7/13/15,8/14/15,"Couples are randomly assigned into one of three treatments. The purpose of the treatments is to exogenously vary experimental female bargaining power. The idea is that an increase in female bargaining power should increase investments in children.

* Treatment 2: Bargaining, the husband and wife has equal experimental bargaining power.
* Treatment 3: Dictator female, the wife has all the experimental bargaining power.",Investments in children,"In the distributive phase, participants are asked to allocate Tsh 15,000 between themselves, their spouse and their child. We use the amount allocated to the child to indicate investments in children. 

In addition to the main outcome variables, we elicit time and risk preferences. In addition, we ask questions about the decision-making in the household. These questions will aid our understanding of differences in investments in children between treatments.",,,"The present project uses a lab-in-the-field approach to collect experimental data. The experiment will be conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in July and August 2015.

The target population is households with non-polygamous couples and at least one child in primary school. Couples have been recruited in the relatively poor neighborhood (ward) Kawe in the Kinondoni municipal, situated in the north-east of the region. There are six primary schools in the area. In June 2015 we distributed an invitation letter to the student's parents. The invitation letters ask parents interested in participating in the study to fill out a form and return it to the head teacher. These forms will be used by local research assistants to contact the parents before the experiment.

We aim to have 450 couples taking part in the experiment, with 150 in each of the three experimental groups.

1. Randomization into treatment.
2. Background information is registered (including age, education, occupation, number of children, number of children in primary school and name and standard of each of the children in primary school).

","Abstract: This paper studies whether an increase in women's intrahousehold bargaining power causes couples to allocate more resources to their child's education, and, if so, what the underlying mechanisms for this might be. We conduct a between-subject lab experiment with couples and vary the relative bargaining power between spouses. The paper provides two main insights. First, increasing the wife's bargaining power improves gender equality in allocation to children's education. However, it does not increase the amount invested in the child's education. Second, we show that the difference in time preferences between spouses matters for how much the household invests in the child's education. It benefits the child that the most patient spouse has more relative bargaining power. This implies that increasing the wife's bargaining power may reduce the allocation to the child's education if she is the less patient spouse. The results provide new insights into the current debate on female empowerment, and highlight the importance of incorporating a broader set of preferences in the analysis of intrahousehold decision-making.

In the three treatment arms, we will introduce attendance “report cards” for each girl in Grade 6 and Grade 7, the last two grades of primary school, with the aim to record and share weekly attendance information with parents. In two of these treatment arms, transfers conditional on regular attendance will also be paid either (i) to parents, in cash or (ii) to the girls, in money-equivalent tokens redeemable against a selected number of items such as clothes, shoes and school bags made available at the school by the research team. The choice of these items was based on qualitative evidence suggesting that they were both valued by girls in the relevant target group and likely to “stick” to the child recipient, contrary to a cash transfer. We reinforce the comparability of the transfers of “cash to parents” and “in kind to daughters” by matching the value of the tokens to that of the cash transfer, and by allowing parents receiving cash to purchase the same items as the girls receiving tokens in the other treatment arm.",,,,2/8/16,12/19/16,"We allocated each sampled school randomly to one of four experimental groups.

In Treatment arms A and B, we introduced a program of transfers conditional on regular school attendance. The verification of the condition triggering the transfers is based on an attendance report card filled in by the main teacher on a daily basis, and intended to be taken home by the pupils every weekend. These report cards are checked independently by the research team between one and three times per trimester during unannounced spot checks.

Treatment arm A - in this group we will give money-equivalent ""tokens"" to girls in Grades 6 and 7 who will then be able to use the tokens to buy a selected number of items such as: clothes (school uniform-type especially), shoes, school bag, smaller materials (pens, notebooks, etc...) made available by the research team at the school. The choice of items listed here is based on focus groups interviews with girls age 12-15 and their parents (interviewed separately) in areas excluded from the experimental sample.  The qualitative evidence collected indeed suggests that these items meet two important criteria: (i) they were consistently cited when children (parents) were asked what gifts could incentivize them (their daughters) to attend school regularly and (ii) both parents and children seemed confident that a girl who was given these items would be able to keep them for herself, and would not be expected to share with anyone else, thus ensuring that this treatment incentivizes the girls themselves rather than their families (other than through the utility they may derive from this extra consumption by their daughters).

Treatment arm B - in this group we give money to the parents, and make the same items as in Treatment arm A available for optional purchase at the school.

Note that in the girls' treatment arm (A), the price in tokens will match the price in Meticais for each item to reinforce comparability with Treatment arm B. In addition, the amount of the cash transfer in arm B will match the value of the tokens in arm A.

Treatment arm C is an ""information"" treatment, in which we introduce the attendance report card system described above for girls in Grades 6 and 7 without any conditional transfers.

","Abstract: To feed a growing population, agricultural productivity needs to increase dramatically. Agricultural extension information, with its public, non-rival nature, is generally undersupplied, and public provision remains challenging. In this study, simple agricultural extension video messages, delivered through Android tablets, were tested in the field to determine if they increased farmers’ knowledge of recommended practices on (i) potato seed selection and (ii) seed storage and handling among a sample of potato farmers in southwestern Uganda. Using a field experiment with ex ante matching in a factorial design, it was established that showing agricultural extension videos significantly increased farmers’ knowledge. However, results suggested impact pathways that went beyond simply replicating what was shown in the video. Video messages may have triggered a process of abstraction, whereby farmers applied insights gained in one context to a different context.

Abstract: Pervasive use of poor quality seed remains an important reason for low yields throughout the developing world. We explore cost-effective ways to increase the quality of the local stock of seed tubers among a sample of Ugandan potato farmers. We do this by providing agricultural extension information on (i) how to select the best seed tubers and (ii) how to properly handle and store seed tubers until the next planting season. The information is conveyed in the form of engaging videos, shown to individual farmers on mobile devices. The relative effectiveness of the information interventions is tested using an individually randomized controlled trial with a 2x2 factorial design. However, such interventions are prone to spillovers, and there are indications that control farmers might have learned about seed selection, storage and handling through their proximity to, or contacts with, farmers in the treatment group. Therefore, we explicitly model spillovers ex post using a randomization-based framework and use both farmers' GPS locations as well as survey data on actual interactions between treatment and control farmers to define the social networks through which information travels. After accounting for spillovers, we find evidence that especially the video containing information on seed selection translated into a higher awareness and adoption of recommended practices, a higher probability of using improved inputs as well as higher consumption

Abstract: Purpose

Pervasive use of poor quality seed remains an important reason for low yields throughout the developing world. We explore ways to increase the quality of the local stock of seed tubers among a sample of Ugandan potato farmers.

Design/methodology/approach: Using videos, we provide agricultural extension information on (i) how to select the best seed tubers and (ii) how to properly handle and store seed tubers until the next planting season. The relative effectiveness of the information interventions is tested using an individually randomized controlled trial where we model spillovers using a randomization-based framework for estimating causal effects under interference between units.

Findings: Especially the video on seed selection translated into increased awareness and adoption of recommended practices, increased probability of using improved inputs, as well as higher consumption.

Practical implications: Interventions aimed at improving seed quality are important in the absence of access to high-quality seed. Video messages are becoming increasingly useful as a complementary tool in agricultural extension.

Theoretical implications: Randomization-based inference can be used to take into account spillover effects in the analysis rather than the design phase of an experiment.

The individuals with stroke would suffer from disease associated symptoms which influence their functioning in everyday life. These symptom clusters were usually known to be sharing similar underlying mechanisms. It is clear that the development of effective stroke rehabilitation involves interdisciplinary team approach to manage physical, social, cognitive, and psychological functioning in this population. 

Tai Chi, an ancient Chinese martial art, is a low intense aerobic exercise characterized by continuous movements that embrace the mind, body, and spirit. Tai Chi addresses the integration and balance of mind and body using the fundamental principles of slow, smooth, and continuous movement control, and the transfer of body weight while maintaining an upright and relaxed posture. The newly developed style of Tai Chi for health programs is the seated Tai Chi, which shares the common Tai Chi principles while being modified to adjust the movements for wheelchair bound patients. 

The present feasibility project aims to apply the suggested principles as the typical features of Tai Chi applied stroke rehabilitation, and to evaluate the effects on physical (balance), psychological, and cognitive function. Only a few studies ever addressed the feasibility of Tai Chi for stroke rehabilitation, and the relationship between cognition and balance in this population is still very early stage of investigation.

This lens is applied to weight loss and obesity. One solution is to bind our future choices to ensure we stay on the right path, using some commitment device. This field experiment tests whether a simple commitment contract to oneself can work in the context of a public weight loss programme to help obese and overweight individuals meet their goals. It further examines heterogeneity pathways and whether the commitment contract works better for some individuals more than others, and if so what this might imply for targeting commitment devices in public health programmes.",,,,1/20/16,1/31/16,"
Participants were randomised into two groups: comparison and treatment.The treatment was the offer of a commitment contract that they were invited to personalise by writing in their names, signature, and date. The contract was designed to have a certain degree of visual gravitas and formality, on card of A5 size that could be carried around in a handbag or satchel, or stuck on a fridge or wall. They were advised to keep it somewhere they would see it on most days, and to discuss it with friends and family if they wished but not with the other group members.  Comparison group members completed a baseline survey and returned to the weight loss group, and asked to continue with the programme as normal. ","

•	Attendance and completion rates over the programme (%).
•	Whether there was any change in food and exercise behaviours.","The primary outcome variable weight loss is calculated as (start weight) – (end weight), with a positive number indicating weight loss. The earliest possible weight reading is taken, which is sometimes the second or third group meeting if participants were late to register for the programme. The final weight reading is taken from week 7 onwards. Participants with missing outcome data after week 7 were contacted to gather follow-up data. Some were not reachable, and interim data suggests an attrition rate of 20%, which is not out of line with published weight loss studies.",,,"I designed an experiment to run in collaboration with the ‘Shape Up’ weight loss programme, run by Camden Council’s Active Health team across various sites in North London. Shape Up is a 12-week, group-based programme that sets a 5% weight loss target for all clients. The group meets every week to discuss a different aspect of weight loss and lifestyle. Class tutors measure and record weight, facilitate group discussion, and coach individuals on their food journal and self-reflection.

The target population is the Active Health team’s client base. These individuals have been screened for eligibility based on their current BMI and home postcode, and might have been put forward for the programme either through a GP or self-referral. These same eligibility criteria apply to participation in the field experiment, and did not change during the trial. Under a normal Shape Up programme, the population have made no financial commitment, but arguably may be conscious of a mild reputational commitment to the group tutor.

The registration process involved a baseline survey with questions on lifestyle, wellbeing and health motivation using the 19-item scale from the Healthy Foundations Segmentation tool - a social marketing model intended to identify which of 5 health motivational groups an individual belongs to.

Health campaigns that aim to educate people about these risks are often ineffective, possibly because consequences may be felt too far in the future, or they fail to account for the determinants of drinking for young people.  However, social image and reputation may be important concerns for young people (Gerrard et al, 2008).  Therefore, a focus on short term social consequences, rather than long term harms may be more appropriate in this population.  This study aims to explore the potential of two online interventions to reduce risky drinking and alcohol related harms in young people compared to controls.  Participants will be young people aged 18-30 who identify as drinking alcohol.  They will complete baseline measures about their drinking behaviours and psychological factors including measures of public and private self-consciousness and prototype perceptions.  They will then be randomised to one of four groups, two interventions and two control groups.  Four weeks later they will complete follow up measures.  Furthermore we will interview approximately 25 people to explore their views about the online interventions.  ",,,,10/12/15,5/31/16,"Arm 1) ‘One too many’ 
The ‘One Too Many’ online intervention focuses on social embarrassment that young people may encounter when drinking to excess.  This novel intervention asks participants about 20 potentially embarrassing situations that they may have experienced while drinking.  The questions were developed following focus group discussions with students and refined by piloting in a number of stages.  For example the questions ask about posting something embarrassing on social media, being sick in public and getting into fights with friends.  On completion, the participant is presented with a social embarrassment score (0-20?).  
Arm 2) Drinks meter
Web-based interventions such as ‘One Too Many’ are advantageous because of their potential to reach large numbers of people, and since intervention fidelity can be maintained.  There is some evidence to suggest that brief interventions delivered using the internet might be effective in targeting alcohol consumption (Bewick et al., 2008).  An appropriate comparison to ‘One Too Many’ therefore is ‘Drinks Meter’ developed by the Global Drug Survey.  Drinks meter uses a traditional ‘identification and brief advice (IBA) approach in which receive personalised feedback about their own drinking, and they also get information about how it compares with other people.   
","Primary outcome measures: 
•	Audit C 
•	Last four week harms (major / minor) 
•	Last four weeks pre-loading

Sub group analyses:

•	Risky drinking at baseline

Secondary outcome measures: 
•	Prototype perceptions
•	Public and private self-consciousness 
","Alcohol consumption will be measured using AUDIT C as this has been found to be an appropriate measure to identify risky drinking in young people (Foxcroft et al, 2014). Drinking related harms will offer a proxy measure for heavy consumption, with a focus on preventable consequences of drinking.  Pre-loading, or consuming alcohol at home before a night out, is associated with high subsequent levels of consumption, intoxication and harms (Foster & Ferguson, 2013).",,,Simple RCT with four conditions ,,Random allocation via Qualtrics Survey Software,Individual ,800 individuals ,800 individuals at baseline and four week follow up ,800,,"Name: Oxford Brookes University

","Abstract: Abstract
Background: Early adolescence is a critical window for intervention when it is possible to lay a foundation for a
safe transition to adulthood, before negative outcomes occur. The Adolescent Girls Initiative–Kenya randomized trial
tested the effects of combinations of interventions for young adolescent girls in two sites – the Kibera informal settlement
in Nairobi and rural Wajir County in the Northeastern region.
Methods: The interventions included community dialogues on the role and value of girls (violence prevention), a
conditional cash transfer (education), weekly group meetings for girls with health and life skills training (health), and
training and incentives for financial literacy and savings activities (wealth creation). Participants were randomized to
one of four study arms: 1) violence prevention only, 2) violence prevention and education, 3) violence prevention,
education and health or 4) violence prevention, education, health and wealth creation. An intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis
was conducted using longitudinal data to estimate the impact of each combination of interventions and various
sensitivity analyses conducted addressing potential attrition bias and multiple hypothesis testing concerns.
Results: In Kibera, the education conditional cash transfer had small effects on grade attainment but larger impacts
on completion of primary school and the transition to secondary school in the most comprehensive arm; the health
intervention improved sexual and reproductive health knowledge and condom self-efficacy; and the wealth intervention
improved financial literacy and savings behavior. In Wajir, the education conditional cash transfer increased
school enrollment and grade attainment, and the wealth intervention improved savings behavior.
Conclusions: The results indicate that when trying to improve a range of outcomes related to adolescent wellbeing
for young girls, a multisectoral intervention with components addressing household economic constraints is a
promising approach.

Abstract: Background
The vast majority of adolescent births occur in low- and middle-income countries and are
associated with negative outcomes for both the mother and her child. A multitude of risk factors
may explain why few programs have been successful in delaying childbearing and suggest
that multisectoral interventions may be necessary. This study examines the longerterm
impact of a two-year (2015–17) multisectoral program on early sexual debut and fertility
in an urban informal settlement in Kenya.
Methods
The study used a randomized trial design, longitudinally following 2,075 girls 11–14 years
old in 2015 until 2019. The interventions included community dialogues on unequal gender
norms and their consequences (violence prevention), a conditional cash transfer (education),
health and life skills training (health), and financial literacy training and savings activities
(wealth). Girls were randomized to one of four study arms: 1) violence prevention only
(V-only); 2) V-only and education (VE); 3) VE and health (VEH); or 4) all four interventions
(VEHW). We used ANCOVA to estimate intent-to-treat (ITT) impacts of each study arm and
of pooled study arms VE, VEH, and VEHW relative to the V-only arm, on primary outcomes
of fertility and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) infection, and secondary outcomes of education,
health knowledge, and wealth creation. Post-hoc analysis was carried out on older girls
who were 13–14-years-old at baseline. In 2018, in the VEHW arm, in-depth qualitative evaluation
were carried out with adolescent girls, their parents, school staff, mentors, community conversation facilitators, and community gatekeepers. The trial is registered at ISRCTN:
ISRCTN77455458.
Results
At endline in the V-only study arm, 21.0 percent of girls reported having had sex, 7.7 percent
having ever been pregnant and 6.6 percent having ever given birth, with higher rates for the
older subsample at 32.5 percent, 11.8 percent, and 10.1 percent, respectively. In the full
sample, ever having given birth was reduced by 2.3 percentage points (pp) in the VE and
VEHW study arms, significant at 10 percent. For the older subsample there were larger and
significant reductions in the percent ever having had sex (8.2 pp), HSV-2 prevalence
(7.5 pp) and HSV-2 incidence (5.6 pp) in the VE arm. Two years after the end of the interventions,
girls continued to have increased schooling, sexual and reproductive health knowledge,
and improved financial savings behaviors. Qualitatively, respondents reported that
girls were likely to have sex as a result of child sexual exploitation, peer pressure or influence
from the media, as well as for sexual adventure and as a mark of maturity.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that multisectoral cash plus interventions targeting the community
and household level, combined with interventions in the education, health, and wealth-creation
sectors that directly target individual girls in early adolescence, generate protective factors
against early pregnancy during adolescence. Such interventions, therefore, potentially
have beneficial impacts on the longer-term health and economic outcomes of girls residing
in impoverished settings.

Abstract: Purpose: Early marriage has multiple drivers including cultural and social norms alongside lack of
educational and economic opportunities. This complexity may explain why few programs have
demonstrated marriage delays and suggests multisectoral interventions are necessary. This study
examined a 2-year multisectoral program designed to delay marriage in a marginalized setting.
Methods: The study used a prospective 80-cluster randomized trial following up 2,147 girls aged
11e14 years from 2015 to 2019. Interventions included community dialogs about inequitable
gender norms (violence prevention), a conditional cash transfer (education), weekly group
meetings with health and life skills training (health), and financial literacy training (wealth creation).
Villages were randomized to one of four study arms: (1) violence prevention only (V-only);
(2) violence prevention and education (VE); (3) VE and health (VEH); or (4) all four interventions
(VEHW).We used analysis of covariance to estimate intent-to-treat impacts of each study arm with
an education component, as well as a pooled study arm combining the VE, VEH, and VEHW arms,
in reference to V-only, 2 years after the intervention ended, when girls were 15e18 years old.
Results: There were small but insignificant reductions on primary outcomes in unadjusted analyses
that were larger and significant in adjusted analyses. Effects were particularly large for girls
not in school at baselinedthe pooled study arm reduced marriage by 18.0 and pregnancy by 15.6
percentage points, a relative reduction of 34% and 43%, respectively.
Discussion: The article demonstrates the potential for multisectoral interventions with education
components to delay early marriage in an impoverished, socially conservative, pastoral setting.

",,,7/6/17,9/8/17,"We will use video to convey information to farmers with the aim of changing adoption behaviour. We will focus on providing information on seed selection, soil nutrient management (including promoting organic fertilizer application), weeding, timely planting and plant spacing. From our conversations with experts, we learn that many farmers may already be aware of the existence and use of these technologies or practices. Therefore, simply providing information about the existence of modern technologies and recommended practices and on how to uses them may not be sufficient to change behavior. Often, access and afford ability was mentioned as a problem. In our videos, we will thus also try to alter the belief that seeds and fertilizers are “too expensive” by pointing out the costs and benefits of the different technologies and practices we promote. In addition, we will encourage farmers to start small, using fertilizer and seeds on a small area of their field to experiment and see for themselves, and reinvest in subsequent years. Inter-temporal decision making, where costs today have to be compared to uncertain outcomes in a distant future, is often challenging for poorly educated farmers. Furthermore, Duflo et al. (2011) point out farmers may have difficulties committing to fertilizer use in Kenya. In our video, we attempt to make farmers aware of this, and suggest some techniques to overcome this bias. We also pay considerable attention to the way the message is delivered. For instance, the message if brought by “peer farmers”, as it is found that farmers find communicators who face agricultural conditions and constrains most comparable to themselves to be the most persuasive (BenYishay et al., 2014). The information is also presented as a success story, which is assumed to affect a range of non-cognitive farmer characteristics such as aspirations, locus of control and self-esteem (Bernard et al., 2015). 

The video starts with a farmer (a male farmer, a female farmer, or a couple, see below) introducing themselves. He talks about how he used to struggle with his maize gardens and how at one point in time, he decided things needed to change. It is shown how the farmer sells a hen, and obtains a small loan from a friend. This money is than used to buy small quantities of improved seed and fertilizer in a local shop. It is then shown that, before planting the improved seed, the farmer prepares the garden. He is shown collecting manure wherever he can find it, and applies it to a small corner of the field of 20m by 20m. Next, it is shown in detail how the maize seeds are spaced 75cm x 30cm with 1 plant per hill and how the DAP should be applied. The viewer is reminded to plant in time. The next scene depicts the field after about 10 to 12 days when the maize has emerged from the ground. At this stage, it is recommended that the farmer engages into gap filling to replace seeds that did not germinate with new seeds to preserve optimal plant density. The next shot shows the field at 18 to 20 days after planing, when first weeding is done. Particular attention is paid to identification of striga in an early stage. It is also advised to weed again two to three weeks later. The next scene zooms in on urea fertilizer application. Here, the field is shown at about 4 weeks after planting when the maize is knee high. It is shown how Urea topsoil dressing should be applied. Finally, it is recommended to do one more round of weeding around the tasseling stage of the maize.

We then spend some time comparing the costs to the benefits the different improved inputs and recommended practices. For fertilizer and improved seed, the costs for one acre is calculated and compared to the value of what is harvested. The profit is then compared to the value of what would have been harvested on that acre without improved seed and fertilizer. This would be less than half of what the profit would be when improved inputs are used. For recommended practices, we report what the expected yield increase would be if, for instance, recommended spacing was used or weeding is done in time.

Next, we try to promote a long run perspective, where the farmer is encouraged to start small (one tenth of an acre) and grow bigger over time. We also pay some attention to the commitment problem. We advise the farmer to, at time of harvest when the farmer sells most of his maize, immediately go to the farm supply store and purchase seeds and fertilizer, and store this in a safe place. If inputs are not available, farmers are encouraged to keep the money needed to buy the inputs in a separate, labeled container. It is sometimes argued that such mental accounting can be an effective commitment mechanism (Dupas et al., 2013). In a last scene, the farmer recapitulates and once more directly addresses the viewer an encourages him or her to try this as well.

A total of three such videos will be produced. They will be identical in terms of the information that will be in the video, but they will differ according to the gender of the messenger, corresponding to one of the factors in the factorial experimental setup. In one version of the video, the actor will be a man. In a second version of the video, the actor will be female. In a third version, the video will feature a couple as the messenger. Here, both male and female will feature in the different scenes, and the person talking to the viewer will be altered between the man and the women. Finally, we will use a placebo video for the control. This will be a neutral video on a non-related topic, such as the tourist potential of the region. Farmers will be shown any of these four videos according to random treatment allocation. Videos will be shown twice to each farmer in the sample, once before planing (July) and once immediately after planting (August).","knowledge related to what is in the videos, behavioural change of things that are featured in the video, such as spacing, soil nutrient management, maize yields, consumption expenditure and poverty. All of these will be measured at the individual level (male/female), women's empowerment in agriculture index.",,,,"This research aims to answer the questions related to information asymmetries within the household, homophilly effects in learning and the projection of farming as a household business. investigate the relative importance of (i) the gender composition of the messenger, and (ii) the gender composition of the audience for effective agricultural extension information messages to encourage sustainable crop intensification in smallholder household farms and for improving gender equity in household farming. In particular, we will compare outcomes at the household level between: 

• households that are shown a video with agricultural extension information and households that are shown a random video (placebo);

• households that are shown a video with agricultural extension information where the animator is an individual “peer” farmer (ie. a man or a women) and households that were shown a video providing the same information by a couple of peer farmers (ie. man and woman who are shown to participate as equals in the family farm and deliver the message as a couple); 

• households in which one adult individual (husband or wife) is shown a video with agricultural extension information and households in which the couple (husband and wife) is shown a video with the same information; 

• households where the gender composition of (the individual) messenger(s) and (individual) audience is matched and households where the gender composition of the messenger and audience differ.

To assess the effect the gender composition of messenger and receiver on equity within the household, we will compare outcomes within the household between:

• households where the video was shown to a man versus households where the video was shown to the husband

• households that were shown the video that promotes a household approach featuring a couple versus households that were shown a video where a single farmer provides the messages

• households that are both shown the video that also projects a household approach to all the other households

For this research question, we will be particularly interested in how these interventions reverberate through intra-household decision-making and the allocation of time and resources to agriculture between the different individuals within the farm household. The outcomes of interest will therefore be disaggregated by gender and age, and interpreted in light of the interplay between efficiency at the household farm level, equity within the farming household and women’s empowerment.

The tools and technologies through which the information is transferred are also likely to influence effectiveness. There are many different ways of delivering agricultural extension messages through ICT. Broadly, one can differentiate between two different approaches. In one approach, extension resembles the traditional teacher-pupil model, where the farmer is assumed to absorb knowledge from experts. Showing videos to farmers or pushing information over a mobile phone would fall into this category. A second approach relies more on a consultative model, where the farmer is assumed to know his or her information needs are and requests this information from a service provider. Call centers and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology are examples of this second approach. In a third research question, we will compare the effectiveness in terms of changing knowledge, practices and outcome such as yields and poverty of video messages to more or less demand based options such as IVR. In particular, we will compare videos to videos augmented with IVR and videos augmented with IVR where the recipient is also provided with reminders of the existence of the IVR service.

The questions will be answered through field experiments, where farmers are randomly assigned to a group that receives particular interventions (de Janvry et al., 2017). An identification strategy that is based on randomization allows us to quantify the causal linkage between an intervention and the outcomes. In particular, we establish the causal link between extension videos and the knowledge gained, between extension videos and yield changes, and between extension videos and poverty (measured by income).

The research design itself will take the form of a mixed level factorial design. To answer the first research question, we define two different factors, each with three levels. The first factor relates to the messenger and has three levels (male, female and male+female). Similarly, the second factor relates to the recipient of the message and also has these three levels (male, female and male+female). The second research question, where video is now augmented with a demand-driven technology such as IVR, corresponds to adding an extra factor with two levels (no IVR, IVR). In practice, we therefore add the IVR treatment to half of the participants who get to see a video. Finally, we will add a pure control group to the design, such that we do not only investigate relative effectiveness of the different attributes, but also relative to someone who did not get to see a video at all. 

The interventions will be targeted at the individual (household) level as opposed to group screenings. Videos will be shown in the house or in the field if necessary. This option guarantees consistency in the treatment and requires the least amount of observations. The videos will be developed in house by the research team and produced by a professional media production company such as NOTV. For IVR, we will partner with Human Network International.

","Abstract: Agricultural advisory services generally rely on interpersonal knowledge transfers by agricultural extension agents who visit farmers to provide information. This approach is not always effective and has proved hard to scale sustainably, particularly in highly dispersed smallholder farming systems. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been advanced as a promising way to overcome many of the problems associated with conventional agricultural extension. We evaluate the effectiveness of an ICT‐mediated approach to deliver agricultural information in a field experiment conducted among small‐scale maize farmers in eastern Uganda. Three complementary technologies designed to address both informational and behavioral constraints to technical change are considered. First, we investigate the effectiveness of audiovisual messages (video) as a means of delivering information on input use and improved maize management practices to farmers. Second, we quantify the additional impact of complementing video with an interactive voice response (IVR) service. Third, we estimate the incremental effect of time‐sensitive short message services (SMS) messages designed to remind farmers about applying key practices at specific points during the season. We find that households that were shown a short video on how to become better maize farmers were performing significantly better on a knowledge test, more likely to apply recommended practices, and more likely to use fertilizer than households that did not view the video. These same households also reported maize yields about 10.5% higher than those that did not view the video. We find little evidence of an incremental effect of the IVR service or SMS reminders.

Abstract: To gain a better understanding of intrahousehold bargaining processes, surveys increasingly collect data from co-heads individually, especially on decision-making, asset ownership and labour contributions. However, answers provided by co-heads to the same set of questions often differ substantially. Recent research suggests that while some of this disagreement is due to random measurement error and cognitive bias, part also reflects non-overlapping information sets. We document differences in answers between male and female co-heads in monogamous smallholder maize-farming households in Uganda. We first confirm that not all disagreement can be explained by measurement error or bias. Using a field experiment, we then test if disagreement is due to information asymmetry between male and female co-heads. We also test an alternative explanation where discord is attributed to co-heads’ tendency to respond in line with prevailing gender norms and social customs. While the interventions did seem to reduce discord in survey response about decision-making, we do not find that information asymmetry nor reporting in line with gender norms and customs are the primary drivers of disagreement.

Abstract: Agricultural advisory services are generally biased towards men, with information targeted mainly to male members within the household, and in formats that often reinforce male dominance in agricultural decision-making. Such biases affect women’s ability to make informed decisions and limit their intra-household bargaining power. Because women’s empowerment in agriculture has many well-established benefits, designing inclusive agricultural extension and advisory services is important. In this study, we challenge the assumption that information is fully shared between co-heads of a household. We also test if portraying women as equally able farmers challenges gender norms and stereotypes in agriculture. We do this through a field experiment in eastern Uganda in which videos that provide information on recommended maize-farming practices are shown to monogamous maize-farming households. In the experiment, we manipulate who within the household is exposed to the information contained in the video. Furthermore, we vary the gender of the person delivering the information in the video. We find that targeting the female co-head alone with information increases her knowledge about recommended practices, her role in agricultural decision-making, her subsequent adoption of recommended practices and inputs, and yields on fields she manages, while the male co-head’s knowledge about the practices and his unilateral decision-making is reduced. When both co-heads are targeted, joint adoption of recommended practices and inputs increases, while the male co-head’s unilateral decision-making is reduced. We find some support that featuring female role models in the videos challenges men’s beliefs and stereotypes about women’s roles in agriculture, and encourages adoption of recommended practices by women. We conclude that if the aim is to empower women, most gains can be made by re-designing advisory services to target information exclusively to the female co-head within the household. Challenging gender stereotypes may create room for increasing women’s involvement in agriculture.

In particular, adoption of safe toilets by poor households is thought to be restricted by credit and informational constraints. Safe toilets entail large investments, accounting for several months of household income for even basic low-cost options. Moreover, households may be unaware of the costs and benefits of safe sanitation. In this study, we consider the impacts of alleviating these constraints on the uptake of safe sanitation in rural India. We do so using a cluster randomised control trial in rural Maharashtra, where we randomly allocate 120 Gram Panchayats (GPs) to one of three arms: (i) access to micro-credit loans for sanitation; (ii) access to micro-credit loans for sanitation, and awareness creation activities; and (iii) a control arm where neither of these interventions was offered. Micro-credit loans could be accessed by the clients of our partner microfinance institution only. In addition to the uptake of safe sanitation, we will also consider whether the interventions improve usage of safe sanitation, and toilet quality, whether they change perceptions of costs and benefits of safe sanitation, and whether microcredit for sanitation crowds out investments on other dimensions, e.g. business. Finally, the design will also allow us to shed light on whether poor households are credit constrained, and not simply credit rationed, for sanitation investments. 


",,,,1/1/15,9/15/17,"We evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions: (i) access to micro-credit for sanitation; and (ii) sanitation credit combined with awareness creation activities. 

The credit intervention provides access to collateral-free, joint liability micro-credit loans for sanitation to clients of a partner microfinance institution. Only individuals who have been clients of the microfinance institution for at least 1 year are eligible to apply for a sanitation loan. The loan covers a maximum amount of Rs. 15000, charging a 22% interest rate annually at a declining balance over a 2-year repayment period. The loans are intended to be used to construct a new toilet or to repair an existing toilet. 

The awareness creation activities are delivered through an NGO and disseminate information on sanitation issues to staff and clients of the microfinance institution, and to the broader community through community-wide activities. Clients of the microfinance institution receive information sessions during their weekly meetings with the loan officer, and were also invited to attend half-day branch-level workshops (Note that each branch covers a radius of around 25 km from the branch office). The community-wide activities included street plays and wall paintings, as well as engagement with community leaders to gain support for their activities and to strengthen awareness of sanitation and hygiene issues, and training of masons on how to construct different low-cost models of safe toilets. The information sessions, wall paintings and street plays disseminated the benefits of safe sanitation on health and non-health dimensions (e.g. safety of females); as well as on the availability and costs of different types of low-cost safe toilets.","The primary outcome will be safe toilet uptake (separately among clients, and non-clients of the microfinance institution). 
","A safe toilet will be defined to be an improved facility for which excreta is safely disposed of in situ or off-site.

Toilet quality will be measured using an index combining household responses to materials used to construct the toilet, and surveyor observations of the toilet. An indicator for a good quality toilet will also be constructed from these variables.

Toilet usage will be measured from questions asking where different groups of household members (e.g. male adults) defecate. They will be coded as using a safe toilet if they use a facility considered to be safe according to the definition above. 

Business profits will be calculated as the difference between revenues and expenditures on the two main enterprises of the household","Secondary outcomes will be toilet quality, toilet usage and open defecation (separately among clients and non-clients of the microfinance institution).
Other outcomes we will study are effects on total household credit, sanitation credit, business investments and profits, education investments, perceptions of costs and benefits of toilets, and uptake of a subsidy for toilet construction offered by the Government of India's Swaccha Bharat Mission policy. All analyses will be conducted separately for clients and non-clients of the microfinance institution.
","Toilet quality will be measured as an index combining household reports and surveyor observations of the toilet.
Toilet usage and open defecation at the household level will be measured as a weighted average of these behaviours across different age-gender groups within the household.
Total household credit will be calculated as the sum of the three largest loans of value > INR 500 taken by the household since the intervention began; and the three largest loans of value < INR 500 taken by households.
Sanitation credit will be measured as a binary variable, and by the value of credit for sanitation purposes
Business investments will be measured as a binary variable for any such investment since baseline
","The study covers two districts in the Indian state of Maharashtra.Within these districts, we cover 120 gram panchayats (GPs), the smallest administrative unit by the Government of India.They have been selected according to two main criteria: (i) they should fall
within currently active operational areas and (ii) neither sanitation loans nor health insurance products should have been offered at any point in time to community members by our implementing partner. 
120 GPs were selected from 133 eligible GPs to be part of the study. The 120 GPs were then assigned to one of the 3 study arms (2 treatment, 1 control) through stratified random sampling, with strata defined according to the district and whether the village was large (> 480 households).
For the baseline survey, we randomly sampled around 30 households per GP stratified by (i) whether a client of our implementing partner ( Grameen Koota) lives in the household and (ii) whether a child under the age of two years lives in the household. The intervention design establishes treatment being clustered at GP level, randomly assigning GPs to different treatment groups, i.e. control, GK (provision of sanitation loans by Grameen Koota) and 'GK + ND' (provision of sanitation loans  by Grameen Koota + awareness creation activities by an NGO - Navya Disha). For the endline survey, we re-survey the 3600 households sampled at the baseline (1800 clients of GK, and 1800 non-clients), and supplement this sample with a further 2400 clients sampled from women who were clients at baseline in the 120 study communities. ",Further details on the trial design and interventions can be found here: https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7957,Randomisation done in office by a computer using Stata 13,Gram Panchayat,120 Gram Panchayats,"The evaluation sample will consist of 4,200 households who had a member who was a client of the microfinance institution before baseline (1,800 interviewed at baseline and endline, and 2,400 at endline only), and 1,800 households without a member who is a client of the microfinance institution before baseline (interviewed at baseline and endline). 
The panel sample of 3,600 households was also stratified by the presence of children aged 0-2 years at baseline.","41 Gram Panchayats (GPs) control,
40 GPs sanitation loans only,
39 GPs sanitation loans + awareness creation activities","We provide minimum detectable effect sizes for uptake of safe toilets among the whole endline sample, client households only, and non-client households only for a power of 0.8, a significance level of 0.05 and assuming two-sided tests. We also assume attrition of around 10% of the panel sample, evenly distributed among client and non-client households. 
For the full sample, with 47 households per cluster on average at endline, and assuming a intra-class correlation of 0.15, this design will allow us to detect increases in safe toilet uptake of around 12.87 percentage points. For clients only, with an ICC of 0.15, the minimum detectable effect size will be 12.42 percentage points, while that for non-clients will be 14.2 percentage points. Inclusion of controls such as the education of the household head greatly reduces the ICC, and allows us to detect smaller effect sizes.","Name: UCL Research Ethics Committee

","Abstract: Imperfect capital markets and commitment problems impede lumpy human capital investments. Labeled loans have been postulated as a potential solution to both constraints, but little is known about the role of the label in influencing investment choices in practice. We draw on a cluster randomized controlled trial in rural India to test predictions from a theoretical model, providing novel evidence that labeled microcredit is effective in influencing household borrowing and investment decisions and increasing take-up of a lumpy human capital investment, a toilet.

Abstract: We exploit novel data collected within a randomized controlled trial of a sanitation microcredit intervention to study how intra-household gender differences in perceptions of costs and benefits of sanitation impact investment decisions. We show that – as long as the wife is involved in household decision-making – the intra-household differences in perceptions we document influence borrowing and investments: uptake of the sanitation loan is higher among households where the wife has higher benefit perception, whereas successful conversion to a toilet depends on differences in monetary cost perceptions. The estimated effects are consistent with the predictions of a model of intra-household decision-making.

","Abstract: Though extension services have long since proved their value to agricultural production and farmer prosperity, their record in sub-Saharan Africa has been mixed. To study the impact of such programs on farmers' learning about agricultural technologies, we implemented a quasi-randomized controlled trial and collected detailed panel data among Malawian farmers. Based on those findings, we develop a two-stage learning framework, in which farmers formulate yield expectations before deciding on how much effort to invest in learning about these processes. Using data centered on farmer beliefs, knowledge, and constraints, we find evidence that beliefs about potential yields hinge on first-hand and local experience, and that these beliefs significantly impact learning efforts. Consistent with this, we find that farmers who participated in season-long, farmer-led demonstration plot cultivation plan to adopt more components of new multi-component technology, compared to farmers who were invited to attend only field-day events.

Abstract: Farmer groups are the cornerstone of many agricultural projects in low income countries. The success of such projects crucially depends on the ability of group members to cooperate. We conducted a series of public goods experiments to study within-group cooperation in Malawian farmer groups. We combine results from these experiments with survey data and qualitative interviews. Our results shed light on the heterogeneous capacity of groups to cooperate. We find that democratically run groups, in particular those with close social ties, are more cooperative compared to groups with leader-driven decision-making. Focus groups indicate that this democracy is deliberative in nature, characterized by open discussion that aggregates preferences, increases common knowledge, and creates goodwill. A second set of experiments in which we experimentally vary the decision-making processes yields quantitatively similar results in arbitrary groupings of farmers and null results in pre-existing groups with established decision-making procedures, demonstrating the stickiness of institutional rules. Our results imply that group formation and functioning needs to be included in the design phase of agricultural projects in low income countries.

Abstract: This paper documents the role of village fairness norms in land markets. A strong and robust relationship is established between experimentally elicited village-level fairness norms and land rental rates across 250 Malawian villages. Stronger fairness norms correlate with a tighter range in village rental rates. The study suggests that the fairness norms for tenants appear to be more important, constraining the land-rental price range by a price ceiling rather than a price floor. The results further indicate that rented-in fields are of lower agronomic quality than owner-cultivated fields, but do not find any statistically significant relationship between the fairness norms and land rental activity in the village.

The economic literature has identified at least three main barriers to SSI take-up among individuals age 65 and over.  First, individuals may not be aware that they are eligible for SSI (SSA 1976, Warlick 1982), which may be a particularly important barrier for individuals for whom being age 65 and over partly determines eligibility.  Second, the expected magnitude of benefits affects take-up (McGarry 2000, McGarry and Schoeni 2015), with individuals with lower expectations about benefits less likely to participate in SSI. Third, potential SSI participants may view the application process as confusing and burdensome (Warlick 1982, McGarry 1996, McGarry and Schoeni 2015).

Yet there are concerns that this support is primarily benefiting wealthier households, due to different electricity rates, liquidity constraints, landlord-tenant issues, length of tenancy, and perhaps even preferences (Borenstein and Davis 2016, Borenstein 2017).

The intervention is specifically designed to foster word-of-mouth and social interaction effects.

The difference between the community-based messaging and the financial-based messaging approaches is that all of the materials given by SmartPower to the ambassadors and potential solar customers exclusively uses very different messages about solar PV. Similarly, SmartPower employees are instructed to exclusively lead with a different set of messages in verbal discussion and to instruct the ambassadors to focus on these messages.","The key outcome variables are solar adoptions, and moderating factors that influence adoptions.",,,,"The program will launch in phases.

","Abstract: This study examines how messaging approaches in a prosocial intervention can influence not only the effectiveness of the intervention but also, contagion afterward. Our investigation focuses on leveraging two motivations for solar adoption: self-interest and prosocial. Using data from a natural field experiment in 29 municipalities containing 684,000 people, we find that self-interest messaging is twice as effective in inducing solar adoption both during and after the intervention. Adoptions under self-interest messaging have 10% higher net present value, but prosocial messaging increases the likelihood that adopters recommend solar to their friends and neighbors. Income moderates the effectiveness of self-interest messaging, performing much better in high-income communities than low- and moderate-income communities. There was no significant difference across income groups for prosocial messaging. These results provide guidance to policy makers aiming to encourage prosocial behavior across all income groups.

We identify individuals by their IP address and randomly sort them into one of two groups: (1) a Control group where individuals see the original version of the job posting, or (2) a Treatment group, where individuals see a version of the job posting which delete optional credentials, delete adjectives describing skills, and reframe vague credentials. 

The Treatment varies depending on the job posting. In some job postings, there are lots of optional qualifications (e.g., “PhD preferred), adjectives describing skills (e.g., “Excellent” before “coding skills”), and vague language/criteria (e.g., “think like your enemy”).  We document the treatment for every job posting included in our experiment (i.e., optional qualifications deleted, adjectives deleted, vague language/criteria reframed). 

Upon seeing the job posting on the Company’s career website, individuals decide whether or not to apply for the position.  For those who decide to apply, the first step is to click on the “Apply Now” button, after which the individual is given the option of applying by signing in (if they already have an account on the Company’s career website), applying using their LinkedIn profile (where data from the individual’s LinkedIn profile is transmitted to the Company), submitting their resume, or applying “manually” by filling out responses to a series of questions. 

We are able to track the treatment status of the applicants in our experiment throughout the hiring process (application, initial phone screen, technical phone screen, on-site interview, and offer).

","Abstract: If women are more sensitive to listed qualifications in job ads, does lowering the bar draw in relatively more women and increase diversity in the applicant pool? We examine this question by randomizing 60,000 viewers into one of two job ad versions for over 600 corporate jobs at Uber, where the treatment removed optional and superfluous qualifications. There are two main findings. First, job seekers of both genders respond to qualifications: applications increase by 7%, owing to similar increases in the number of applications from men and women. Second, reducing the qualifications impacts the type of individual who chooses to apply differently by gender. Reducing the qualifications draws in less skilled women and causes an outflow of some highly skilled women. Conversely, the treatment draws in men from across the skill distribution, including the upper end. We find gender differences in application behavior and explore potential mechanisms in a separate, large-scale survey using the RAND American Life Panel. These results highlight that sensitivity to listed requirements is complex, and simply lowering the qualifications in job postings is not guaranteed to increase applicant diversity.

We design a randomized experiment on a sample of workers in a large Italian company, and introduce smart-working for 9 months for a randomly selected group of workers in the sample. By comparing the two groups of workers - those subject to smart-working and the others - before and after the introduction of smart-working, we find causal evidence that the introduction of smart-working increases productivity of workers and their well-being.
To assess the effective success of the introduction of flexibility, we administered 2 questionnaires: one before the introduction of the policy, and one immediately after the end of the trial policy. In these questionnaires, after questions on general socio-demographic variables, we have asked questions about several dimensions: productivity at work, flexibility, individual well-being, individuals’ work-life balance and commitment towards the company.

However, in order to obtain a more objective measure of we will also ask workers’ supervisors to report on this matter. Finally we have asked to the firm to measure productivity also with objective indicators. For the others outcome we consider the single answers to the questionnaires pre/post policy and a grouped occurrence of them.

To Assess the Effectiveness of Various Communication Strategies for Improving Childhood Pneumonia Case Management: A Community Based Behavioral Open Labeled Trial in Rural Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India

Executive Summary 
Background: Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide and in India. Many of these deaths can be averted by creating awareness in the community about early symptoms of CAP and by ensuring availability of round the clock, quality health care.

Hypothesis
Strengthening of public health system to provide sustainable quality care for cases of childhood pneumonia (CAP) followed by strategic dissemination of validated messages to community may improve care seeking behavior for CAP within 12 months that can be measured by 50% improved utilization of services from qualified public health care providers (over the current utilization rate of 25%).  

Primary Objective 1
To assess the effectiveness of an innovative package of “Community Orientation” of doctors and ANMs and ASHAs, PLUS infrastructural strengthening by (i) providing “Pneumonia Drug Kit” (PDK) (ii) establishing “Pneumonia Management Corner” (PMC) at Primary Health Center (PHC) and (iii) “Pneumonia Management Unit” (PMU) at Community Health Center (CHC) ALONG with one of the 4 different behavior change communication interventions:	

Intervention 1: Organizing Childhood Pneumonia Awareness Sessions (PAS) for caregivers of children <5 years of age during a routine immunization day, using self-developed and validated IEC materials, in APHCs and CHC monthly, conducted by a trained ANM and project facilitator. 

Intervention 2: Organizing PAS on Village Health and Nutrition Day (V.H.N.D.) only once a month by the ASHA worker trained for this.

Intervention 3: Combination of Both Intervention 1& 2

Intervention 4: Usual Care 

On: Number of clinical pneumonia cases-treated by ANMs/doctors with medicines from PDK OR Treated at either PMC or PMU

Primary Objective 2
To ascertain change, if any, in the types of health care providers’ service utilization for acute respiratory illness (ARI)/CAP in last one year in children less than 5 years pre and post intervention. 		

Research Design
A prospective Community Based Open Labeled Behavioral Trial conducted in 2 by 2 factorial design in 8 rural blocks of Lucknow district after (a) capacity building of doctors, ANMs and ASHA workers by conducting training sessions and (b) establishing of PMC, PMU and distribution of PDK and ensuring other infra-structural up-gradation for facility based management of CAP. Health facility audits will be done to collect information on process indicators, i.e., (i) utilization of PDK, PMC and PMC and (ii) conduct of PAS sessions in APHC, CHC and/or during V.H.N.D. monthly. This will give also information for the primary objective 1. Community survey will be done by multistage cluster sampling to collect information on changes in the types of health care providers’ service utilization for ARI/CAP pre and post intervention.

Data Management
Data will be managed on MS-Excel. Data analysis will be done on SPSS. Tests of proportion will be applied to compare outcomes across the 4 intervention arms.

Implications
The project will build public health infrastructure for managing CAP.  It will also bring about a positive change in the community behavior when confronted with a case of CAP.  This will improve quality of care of CAP and thus result in reduced mortality in Lucknow district.  Since the work will be done in partnership with the government, it can be scaled up and thus will result in reduced infant and under-fives mortality rate and help in achieving MDG 4.

Situations where one gives up own material payoff in order to increase someone else's material payoff are ubiquitous. In experimental economics, they are modeled as ‘dictator games’ and have been analyzed in great depth. What has gone unnoticed is that there are many games that are being studied under the label 'dictator game' in the laboratory, and that these game differ critically with respect to whether the underlying context is such that one player only gives and another player only receives, or whether players give and take at the same time. These two protocols come with crucially different (Nash) equilibrium predictions, even if players are allowed to have substantially pro-social preferences. Across the experimental literature, there has been a shift from the former –‘non-interactive’– dictator game implementation to the latter –‘interactive’– dictator game implementation. In this study, we will therefore implement dictator games using both protocols to improve our understanding of how these different protocols affect giving decisions.","Description: Full RCT registry with details, data, and analysis files.
Url: https://osf.io/fsg52/
",,,11/21/17,11/22/17,"The main hypotheses concern fundamental differences in giving decisions between the two protocols: The non-interactive protocol predicts intermediate payments if a subject has some distributional and altruistic concern for the recipient's material well-being. By contrast, Nash equilibria of the games induced by the interactive protocol are characterized by extremal payments (either full or null payments), and in particular by increased levels of zero-giving for low prices of redistribution.

Additional hypotheses can be tested by varying the 'price of redistribution' p, that is, the factor by which each unit of material payoff that is given up is multiplied and sent to the recipient: in the interactive protocol, the Nash equilibrium prediction is that the peak at null (full) decreases (increases) in p. 

We do a standard economic experiment conducted online. Recruitment will be done through a pre-registered subject pool from Amazon's Mechanical Turk, as used by the Decision Science Laboratory of ETH Zurich. Earnings will include a fixed show-up fee, and a variable bonus that depends on decisions of the subjects. We will not exclude any specific set of subjects except for ones that took part in dictator game experiments in the last three months, and we will pay subjects based on the decisions they take during the experiment according to online experiments standards. We aim to run the study before January 2018.

We plan to run 5 sessions of two-times-both treatments involving 20 active decision-making participants per session per treatment = 200 active subjects per treatment, which leads to a total of 600 subjects (of which 200 are inactive ""recipients"" in one of the treatments).","The above mentioned 20 dictator games will be played under the two treatments/protocols described above. In each treatment, one randomly selected game will be chosen for payment.  In each treatment, each dictator plays 20 dictator games. The games vary with respect to p, the price of redistribution of the amount given: given any p, the recipient receives p-times what was given. We chose all prices of redistribution from 0.1 to 2.0, and dictators will face them in random order.",,,,"We will compare the resulting two giving distributions using various standard statistics including the arithmetic mean, median, variance, as well as higher moments of the distribution and other distributional measures such as bimodality, etc. In addition, we will define dummy variables for extremal (zero and full) giving decisions.","To test distributional differences between the two treatments we will use the following non-parametric tests:

•	distributional differences using Kolmogorov-Smirnov 

•	differences in mode using Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon if KS test shows no significant distributional differences 

•	Equality of variance tests: Levene’s Test (using mean), Brown–Forsythe test (using median) if KS test shows no significant distributional differences

In addition, we identify whether extremal payments are more likely to be made under interactive versus non-interactive and whether zero-giving occurs more frequently for low p's, and full giving more frequently for high p's. These tests will rely on

•	Logit regression for dummy “giving was zero” and for dummy ""giving was full"". Interaction effects between treatment and level  of p are  included, controlling for subject fixed effects as each dictator decided for all values of p. Regressions are repeated adding variables related to beliefs (as collected via the exit survey); in particular the following variables are added: we ask subjects to specify how many tokens they expected a random other subject to give when in the role of the dictator. We would add this value as a control. Moreover, we ask whether they would have given more (less) if they knew more (less) was given, and we will add two dummies respectively specifying whether the answer to this question is yes or no.","We run a standard two-group, between-subject experiment, with random allocation of roles (dictator vs recipient) in the non-interactive protocol. We will balance sessions by day and time.

In each session, half of the subjects per session are randomly matched into one of two treatments and into one of the two games played per treatment, each subject playing exactly one protocol. In addition, there will be random allocation of roles (dictator vs recipient) in the non-interactive protocol. Active players will face decision situations in random order. Payment is based on one randomly selected decision per dictator.","Since we are comparing the protocols between-subject, we implement the experiment in the interest of budget and reasonable statistical power to have at least n=200 active subjects per treatment.

A total of 600 participants is about as much as we can afford given our budget situation.

Recruiting fewer subjects is not desirable as previous experimental from dictator games (under either protocol) consistently shows that a proportion of subjects (up to 50% in total) always and independent of treatment give either nothing or half, thus reducing the variation of people that could be affected by treatment variations.","Since we are comparing the protocols between-subject, we implement the experiment in the interest of budget and reasonable statistical power to have at least n=200 active subjects per treatment.

Moreover, many environments require repeated decisions. When periods are stochastically independent, do agents respond to an adverse outcome? And does it matter for their response whether the strategic or the natural risk materialized to cause the event?

We design an experimental choice situation that contains both strategic and natural uncertainty and repeat the situation once, after feedback on first-round outcomes. Observing the behavior of experimental subjects in both rounds allows us to investigate whether the experience of a zero-payoff outcome in the first choice situation affects participant's behavior in a second choice situation and whether the source of the zero-payoff matters. Payoffs are determined by joint play between the subject and a co-player in a game of chicken and by the outcome of a lottery draw.  While the rounds are independent in statistical (random rematching) and payoff terms (random determination of payoff-relevant round), casual observation and evidence from cognate experiments suggests that choice behavior is likely to differ depending on whether the zero-payoff event materialized or not. This behavioral response conceivably also differs depending on whether natural or strategic uncertainty is seen as the reason for the zero-payoff event. Our experiment is designed to detect the presence and nature of such behavioral changes. Furthermore, we ask whether age, gender, or educational status can explain observed choices and changes in choices. Finally, we study whether a change in the perception of what caused the outcome mediates the effect of experience on the change in choices.",,,,9/27/18,9/27/19,"Participants are recruited through an online platform and are asked to make two payoff relevant choices as well as answer questions about their beliefs on other participant's play as well as on the outcome of an urn draw. Participants are either matched with a computer co-player or a human co-player. In the latter case, they are randomly re-matched with another co-player for their second choice.",Do participants change their choice between the first and the second round?,,,,"We match participants with a co-player to play a game of chicken. The eventual payoff of the players depends on their play in the game and on the draw of a lottery. That is, when a ""red ball"" is drawn in the lottery, or when both players choose ""action B"" in the chicken game, they receive a payoff of zero. When a participant chooses ""action A"" in the chicken game, and a ""green ball"" is drawn in the lottery, she receives a payoff of 1 USD and when a participant chooses ""action B"" in the chicken game, while her co-player chooses ""A"", and a ""green ball"" is drawn in the lottery, she receives a payoff of 3 USD. 

We play two rounds of this game and randomly rematch players (perfect stranger matching). After the first round, full information about the outcome of the lottery and the choice of the matched co-player is provided. Participants receiving a payoff of zero will therefore know exactly whether the event can be attributed to the unfortunate realization of the natural uncertainty, or the strategic uncertainty, or both.  In round two, participants are tasked to again choose between A and B. Finally, we ask participants not only to make payoff-relevant choices, we also elicit their perceptions about the cause of the outcome. We do so at two points in time: first, after they have made their first choice but before they know the outcome, and second, after they have learned the outcome from the first round and before they make their second choice.",,Computer,Individual,"900 observations per treatment (human condition or robot condition), so 1800 in total.",1800,900,,,"March 08, 2019; October 31, 2019; March 24, 2022",,True,,,,,,,,,,"

An important part of this interest are effects on those working for these organizations. Do workers perceive public organizations as different in characteristics, including their goals, than otherwise similar private, for-profit organizations and what are the consequences? We take as a starting point the issue of whether ownership cues that convey information about the organization's ownership status affect people’s perception of organizations and the way they work for them. We conduct an experiment recruiting online workers via Amazon’s crowdsourcing platform Mechanical Turk to address these questions using random allocation of interventions (for more details please see following sections).

","Secondary outcomes are the time take to complete the work task, the ratio between mistakes and time, and whether they agree to do an additional 7th worksheet (after completing the 6 worksheets), which ought to measure their prosocial work behavior (because they agree to do an additional worksheet for the organization), assuming that this would be higher in public versus for-profit organizations. Measures of this kind are widely used in the literature.",These additional outcomes are further affected by the interventions. ,US MTurkers recruited to the study and allocated to different experimental groups,"Subjects who enroll as workers on Amazon Mechanical Prime will be recruited. Amazon does not allow any individuals below the age of 18 to work on the Mechanical Turk platform, hence we will only recruit subjects of at least 18 years of age. A total of 600 adult workers will be recruited through the platform. Recruitment will be restricted to MTurkers who are based in the US. This can be done using MTurk’s graphics interface so that the work announcement (also called a HIT [Human Intelligence Task]) will only be accessible for US MTurkers.
Workers receive financial compensation for participation. All US MTurkers are eligible, and the task will close as soon as 600 subjects have entered it. Inclusion criteria are that the target population are all US-based MTurkers. The recruitment of turkers is to work for something labelled as an elderly care home timesheet, with the different labels for the type of organization constituting the variation in intervention. Participants are asked if they utilized tools that might help them in the task (a calculator). Additional measures are nine items that tap the individual’s conscientiousness taken from the Big Five personality traits inventory. People are also asked about their gender, age and what type of organization they do work for (public, private or nonprofit). The final question is a manipulation check, asking participants if they remember whether the organization mentioned on the time sheets is a public or private, for-profit organization. At end of the study, part pants are debriefed and informed about the full purpose of the study.

We report the results of a randomized evaluation of this program. We hypothesize that the program raises HIV testing rates by reducing imperfect information (related to HIV) and by reducing HIV-related stigma concerns. Primary outcome variables are survey-reported and directly-observed rates of HIV testing. We also examine a range of secondary outcomes related to information and stigma mechanisms, and secondary outcome variables such as school attendance and overall household well-being. Causal identification exploits multilevel random assignment (of communities to program receipt, and of treatment-community households to strong encouragement for program participation), allowing separate identification of impacts on households of being in a program community (with take-up at the community-average rate), versus having been strongly encouraged to participate the program (with very high take-up). We also examine spillovers (based on geographic proximity or social network connections) from strongly encouraged to other households. Additional treatments randomly assigned by our research team allow insight into complementarities with interventions providing targeted information and financial incentives for HIV testing.",,,,1/1/17,12/31/20,,We consider the following outcome variable to be primary outcome of interest: HIV testing at the household level (binary outcome),"The outcome variable of primary interest is HIV testing at the household level. This will be a binary outcome indicating that the household either self-reports having had or is directly observed by our survey staff having an HIV test upon our recommendation.  This outcome captures the combination of having already had an HIV test, as well as openness to recommendations for future testing, both of which may be influenced by exposure to the FCC program.
To be specific, the component variables of this outcome variable are:

-	HIV testing (self-reported): an indicator that anyone in the household has been tested for HIV in the last 12 months. This is a household-level variable equal to 1 if at least one household member is reported to have had an HIV test in the last 12 months, and 0 otherwise. 
-	HIV testing (directly observed): an indicator that at least one of a household’s HIV testing coupons has been redeemed. This is a household-level variable equal to 1 if at least one of a household’s incentive coupons is presented at the local health clinic for the HIV testing incentive payment before the 14-day deadline, and 0 otherwise.  

Our composite HIV testing outcome is therefore equal to 1 if HIV testing (self-reported) is equal to 1 or HIV testing (directly observed) is equal to 1, and 0 otherwise.

One proposal to address this erosion of income for low-wage workers has been to expand the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which supplements the earnings of families by as much as $6,000 a year. But the federal EITC for single tax filers, which is capped at a maximum annual payment of only $487, is much less generous and as a result less effective at increasing employment and reducing poverty. The Paycheck Plus demonstration is testing the effects of a more generous EITC-like earnings supplement for low-income single adults in New York City and Atlanta, Georgia, in which the credit for workers without children is increased to $2,000 and extended to provide benefits to workers earning up to $30,000 per year, with the maximum payment being made to those with earnings between $6,667 and $18,000.

The primary outcomes will be examined for the full sample and for three sets of subgroup comparisons for Paycheck Plus in Atlanta following Miller et al. (2018) for Paycheck Plus in New York City. The three key subgroup comparisons will be:
(1) Women vs. Men;
(2) More Disadvantaged Men (defined as noncustodial fathers or previously incarcerated men) vs. Other Men;

","The goal of Paycheck Plus to try to improve the employment, earnings, and income of low-income childless single adults. Standard economic theory predicts a (weakly) positive impact of an expanded EITC on employment (measured on the extensive margin) for singles, a (weakly) positive impact on income (as measured by net earnings, or earningsafter taking into account taxes and the bonus), and ambiguous effects on pre-tax earnings.","Extreme poverty (household annual income below 50 percent of the poverty line); (size-adjusted) household annual income; child-support payments; mental health (depression/anxiety); physical health status; federal tax filing; criminal-justice-system involvement, and family formation.  ","Paycheck Plus (an expanded EITC) could impact a wide range of outcomes both through any behavioral effects on labor supply and through the receipt of the bonus itself. Participants need to file federal taxes to receive the Paycheck Plus bonus so one also may expect an impact on tax filing rates.
 
","The evaluation of Paycheck Plus uses a random assignment research design, with a program group who is eligible to receive the expanded credit and a control group who is not. Individuals in the program group in each city will be eligible for the credit payments for three years. In Atlanta, individuals can receive the credit for earnings in tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018. Both research groups will be tracked for up to four years to determine the effects of the expanded credit on outcomes.

In this project, we sent letters to eligible farmers (located near zones where PES are available) informing them of their eligibility, of the type of program available to them (practices subsidized and subsidy amount) and providing them with the contact information to caseworkers in charge of helping them with their application. We also varied the content of the letter, adding testimonies of farmers already benefiting from PES and the ease of response by adding easy to use pre-stamped return letters. Finally, we test for the existence of a social multiplier in the numbers of letters sent by varying the proportion of farmers in a given commune receiving the letter.

The goal of the FFWS is to increase postsecondary access for economically disadvantaged students in Wisconsin, which the FFWS works to achieve by providing need-based grants. A student is eligible to receive one of these grants if she graduated from a Wisconsin high school, attends a public college or university in the state (including technical colleges) full time, and is eligible to receive a federal Pell Grant. Students do not directly apply for the FFWS grant. Rather, each public institution in Wisconsin uses internal data to identify the set of eligible students enrolled at the school. Each institution then sends its list of eligible students to the Wisconsin Higher Educational Aids Board (HEAB), which randomly assigns students to receive an FFWS offer. Students selected for the FFWS offer receive an award letter that they are instructed to sign and return to the FFWS in order to access the funds—the grants are $1,800/year for students enrolled in two-year institutions and $4,000/year for students at four-year schools. Students not selected for the award are typically unaware they were even eligible. Students who follow the instructions in the award letter have their FFWS automatically renewed—up to a maximum of ten semesters—as long as they meet the initial eligibility criteria and make satisfactory academic progress. The first FFWS grants were awarded in the 2008-09 school year—about 1,200 offers were made that year—and approximately 1,200 offers have been made each subsequent year, allowing us to analyze the effects of the award across several recipient cohorts. As the organization believes program implementation improved after the first cohort, we will only be analyzing the subsequent cohorts. Our outcomes will include employment, wages, and the receipt of means-tested benefits such as SNAP and TANF.  ",,,,9/1/08,1/15/22,"The intervention is an offer of need-based financial aid for low-income Wisconsin college students. We say the intervention is a financial aid offer, and not the aid itself, because 1) not all students accepted the offer, and 2) the grant is designed to satisfy unmet need and not to replace other forms of grant aid (i.e., non-loan aid). Thus, a student will not receive FFWS grant money if her need it completely met by other forms of grant aid in a given semester, and the amount actually received varies across students. 

The size of the grant depends on both the cohort and the type of school where a student is enrolled. Students in technical and two-year colleges can receive up to $1,800 per academic year. Early in the program, four-year students could receive up to $3,500 per academic year. Recently, that amount increased to $4,000 (in the 2015-16 school year). Students can continue to receive these funds for up to ten semesters as long as they continue to meet eligibility requirements (see below). ","a)	Employment in Wisconsin

f)	Quarterly wages/employment/means-tested benefits: In addition to the above annual measures, we will also create quarterly versions of the outcome variables. Wage/employment records are quarterly by nature, and will be coded as described above. The means-tested benefits records are monthly by nature, so these outcomes will be broken into three-month increments to create quarterly versions. The coding decisions will remain the same as described above.
","At the beginning of each school year, University of Wisconsin System (UWS) colleges and Wisconsin Technical College System (WTCS) colleges submit a list of newly enrolled students who are eligible to receive the grant to the Higher Educational Aids Board (HEAB). HEAB compiles all of the eligible four-year students into one pool and all of the eligible two-year students (i.e., two-year UWS students and WTCS students) into another and conducts a blocked randomization (see the eligibility requirements below). HEAB randomly selects around 1,100 to 1,300 total students for the treatment condition with the goal that 500 students in each randomization block will accept the award (see Table 1 of the pre-analysis plan for the selection and take-up rates by cohort). The treatment group are those eligible students who were randomly selected for the award (regardless of whether they accepted), while the control group are those eligible students who were not randomly selected. We note that eligible students are identified on the basis of administrative data alone; students need not take any active steps to enter into consideration. 

The requirements for initial grant eligibility are the following (from the FFWS website): 
a)	be a resident of Wisconsin 
b)	have been a full-time, resident student in a Wisconsin public school for four semesters prior to graduation 
c)	have received a Wisconsin public high school diploma or HSED within the past three years 
d)	be under the age of 21 years at initial eligibility 
e)	be in a first degree program unless moving from an associate degree to a bachelor’s program 
f)	be enrolled full time in a UW System university based in Wisconsin 
g)	be a PELL recipient 

To maintain eligibility for the grant (for up to ten semesters) students in a given semester must meet the following criteria (from the FFWS website): 
a)	student’s college enrollment at a UW college or university or WTCS (Wisconsin Technical College System) college is full time 
b)	enrollment does not exceed six semesters in a WTCS or a UW college [i.e., two-year UW colleges] 
c)	adequate academic progress is being made with degree completion expected 
d)	student’s school continues to follow the grant process 
e)	FAFSA is completed. 

Students receive funds in that semester only if they have unmet need (i.e., financial need minus grant aid offers). 

One notable feature of the program is that students maintain grant eligibility if they transfer to another eligible school (i.e., an eligible technical college or University of Wisconsin two-/four-year college).

","Abstract: We experimentally estimate the effects of a need-based financial aid offer on students’ annual in-state employment and earnings up to eight years after the initial offer. For students in four-year universities, we show the aid offer to reduce employment and earnings throughout the period we study but provide evidence of increased effort on coursework during students in-college years. We examine the role of outstate migration and reduced loan debt in generating the negative effects in students’ post-college years. We find no significant effects of the aid offer on the labor market outcomes of individuals in two-year institutions.

Many decisions people take, such as deciding whether to do an urgent, but not particularly important task right now, have low immediate costs – checking emails – but may have large costs later on, such as requiring one to work late when tired to make up the lost time. While sometimes people may take such decisions in full awareness of these implications – either because it is the ‘right/rational’ decision, or because they are present-biased – it may also be due to not thinking about these future implications.

Elicitation of the willingness to accept a payment in order to complete a task across different treatments. Thus the questions are two, linked to the framing of doing extra work: the first concerns doing extra work after a (changing) fixed mandatory work; the second is whether the framing as doing extra work 'before' rather than 'after' - while holding the actual consequences constant - leads to a change in willingness to work, which it cannot under any broadly framed theory.

We want to measure whether there is a correlation between subject's level of narrow bracketing in deterministic work choices and narrow bracketing in risky choices. We will test whether people make the same mistake when they see both choices, controlling for an order effect. 
","See latest pdf document for change in design. 

The following previous design description is included for completeness, but is *NOT* what we are currently planning on running.

It may be that people bracket narrowly, but not if they see the broadly bracketed version first. Thus a person who is asked for their WTW for 20 tasks rather than 10, and then asked for their willingness to do 10 tasks before doing the 20, may realize that these questions are the same, and thus broadly bracket the second question. If asked first for their WTW for 10 tasks before 10, and then for their WTW 20 rather than 10, their answer to the ""10 before 10"" may be different because they did not realize that it is about doing 20 rather than 10 tasks. Thus we want to measure whether the same question leads to different answers depending when people are asked the question.

Since one concern is that people may either use heuristics to make decisions faster (""This is 10 extra tasks, so I'll give the same answer as before"") or want to be consistent with their past choices once they realize they are the same (""Oh, 20 vs 10 tasks is the same as my previous answer, I should give the same answer"") rather than admit they might have gotten it wrong (Augenblick and Rabin (2018) do find that this effect is quite strong in their experiment, when subjects are reminded of their past choice) this will not cleany establish which choice people think is a mistake, but together with the between-subjects design it should shed light on it. 

Ignoring these other concerns (heuristics, desire for consistency), we will use these answers to create a measure of narrow bracketing at the individual level: the degree to which the BROAD answer is different from the NARROW answer, and we'll do so accounting for order effects. 

The reason for testing correlation between individual-level narrow bracketing in our context and in risky choices (based on our within-subjects treatment) is straightforward: we want to see if there are people who are more likely to narrow bracket in different types of settings.","In an online experiment, using a real effort task, we measure whether psychological factors affect the decisions to work extra time.","See latest pdf document for change in design. 

The following previous design description is included for completeness, but is *NOT* what we are currently planning on running.

In an online experiment with real effort tasks, we measure whether decisions for extra work are narrowly bracketed: whether people make decisions for extra work by thinking only about the direct disutility incurred from doing the extra work, or whether they also take into account the indirect effects of this extra work on other work they already have to complete. Specifically, subjects will be asked to complete a fixed and given amount of work and then be asked to do additional work. 

The design is based on a 2x2 + 2 treatments (WTW stands for 'Willingness to Work'):

2 x 2 design
- NARROW (10 vs 20): Subjects are asked for their WTW for additional tasks when there are either 10 or 20 required tasks (between subjects treatments). They are not told whether these tasks are done before or after the main tasks. Their choice will be on the extra tasks only.
- BROAD (10 vs 20): Subjects are asked for their WTW for additional tasks when it is made clear that they are in addition to the (10 or 20) required tasks. Their choice will be on the total tasks.

+2 treatments
- NARROW BEFORE: Subjects are asked for their WTW for additional tasks before doing some required tasks.
- NARROW AFTER: Subjects are asked for their WTW for additional tasks after doing some required tasks.

In all choices the choice to work extra time for the same piece-rate - the choice set is fixed, including no extra requirements or benefits from working fast or slow. A person who brackets narrowly may nonetheless act differently: they may not perceived the extra work differently regardless of this be done on top of different required work. Also, they may perceive the extra tasks differently if they are framed as having to be done before or after the required work. We consider as a control treatment the BROAD treatment, in which subjects are told that they choose between the required work (say 10 or 20 tasks) or the required work plus extra work. Thus is the most transparent choice, and the one that economic theory would say is 'the right' framing, under standard assumptions on utility over work. 

If people bracket narrowly and find the first 10 tasks easier than the last 10 tasks (increasing marginal disutility), then our hypotheses are the following:

- NARROW BEFORE: A person who brackets narrowly should choose as if (or more closely towards) BEFORE ONLY, since they are thinking only of the 10 tasks, not about how it makes the other 10/20 tasks harder.
- NARROW AFTER: A person who brackets narrowly and thinks of doing work after 10/20 tasks should choose as they would in BROAD. However, it may be that the reminder of the required tasks is ignored and not integrated with this choice.

Overview of the main experiment:


•	Experiment based on the transcription task similar to the one used by Augenblick and Rabin (2015).

•	The experiment will be conducted online (via Lioness Lab, Arechar et al., 2018).

•	PART 1 Mturkers are invited to participate to the first part of the experiment online.

o	PHASE 1: Subjects practice with the transcription task.
o	PHASE 2: Subjects are told that they are rewarded a fixed amount (participation fee), for performing a fixed required task.
o	PHASE 3: Depending on treatment, they will be given the opportunity to choose YY extra tasks for a set of given piece-rates. 

We elicit the willingness to work (WTW) with a slider to select the number of sequences to decode for a given piece rate payment (e.g. for $0.05/sequence how many sequences are you willing to decode?)

•	PART 2
o	PHASE 1: One of the choices made during the PHASE 3 will be selected randomly and implemented.
o	PHASE 2: Subjects will work and will be rewarded according to the schedule.
o	PHASE 3: At the end of the working part, subjects will be asked to answer to a series of incentivized questions, replicating Rabin and Weizsäcker (2009) with low stakes.

Without narrow bracketing, all choices except BEFORE ONLY should be identical. However, BEFORE ONLY and BROAD are identical, then our problem is that we have no power to identify narrow bracketing, as both narrow bracketing and broad bracketing give exactly the same answer: all answers should be the same, no matter whether subjects bracket broadly or narrowly. Why might this happen? It can happen if the first 10 tasks are exactly as painful as the next 10, and as the next 10, and so on. In that case narrow bracketing doesn't lead to a mistake. Another reason this can happen is that people *think* that 10 tasks are always equally painful (even if it turns out that they are not). 

For this reason we run the following pilot to identify whether subjects think that the task gets harder (as well as whether they end up believing that). Note that what truly matters is the *beliefs* people have at the time they make the choices, not whether it actually ends up being more tedious.

In the pilot we ask them the same question as in the main study regarding whether they expect work to become more or less tedious (a question on a 10-point scale).

","Abstract: Many important economic outcomes result from cumulative effects of smaller choices, so the best outcomes require accounting for other choices at each decision point. We document narrow bracketing — the neglect of such accounting — in work choices in a pre-registered experiment on MTurk: bracketing changes average willingness to work by 13-28%. In our experiment, broad bracketing is so simple to implement that narrow bracketing cannot possibly be due to optimal conservation of cognitive resources, so it must be suboptimal. We jointly estimate disutility of work and bracketing, finding gender differences in convexity of disutility, but not in bracketing.

Description: In this study, we found that sending reminders was an effective and scalable intervention strategy to increase vaccination coverage in an older adult population with low vaccination coverage. Communicating the social benefits of vaccinations, in addition to individual benefits, did not enhance vaccination coverage. The effectiveness of letter reminders about the benefits of vaccination to improve influenza vaccination coverage may depend on the prior vaccination history of the population.

","Abstract: ● Overall, the findings provide evidence of widespread positive and statistically significant effects of the treatment on awareness of a number of growth and performance related management tools (e.g. critical task lists, business model canvas, lean business canvas, SWOT analysis). These effects prove robust across a range of different model specifications. Effects on the use of the tools are generally somewhat weaker. There is also evidence of increased adoption of various performance related business behaviours (e.g. formation of mission and vision statements, formal business planning).
● All of the businesses in the treated group reported positive outcomes in at least two of the four key areas in which support was provided. More than three quarters of these businesses (78%) reported positive outcomes in all four areas.
● The evaluation data provide good evidence that in most, but not all cases, the treatment received was causally significant to the outputs reported.
● The significance of these effects is striking due to two issues which arose during the conduct of the trial: partial take-up of the treatment and attrition in the follow-on survey.

Description: We partnered with the recruitment platform Applied, which aims to remove bias from
the hiring process. We ran a pre-registered four-armed RCT on the platform to test
whether alternative introductory statements to an equal opportunities form in a job
application could change applicants’ voluntary disclosure rates of sexual orientation.
Each alternative introductory statement addressed a key negative attitude towards
disclosure of sexual orientation: mistrust about the security of data storage, the belief
that disclosure could harm recruitment outcomes, and a lack of understanding of the
purpose or value of disclosure.
None of the treatment statements had a significant impact on the probability of
sexual orientation disclosure. Neither did they change the probability of opting out of
the entire disclosure form, the disclosure rates of any other demographic
characteristics or of submitting the application. This suggests that introductory
statements that target negative attitudes towards disclosure are not effective in this
context. Possible explanations for the findings are that applicants do not pay
attention to the introductory text, other behavioural barriers are more important or
that the already high disclosure rate in this recruitment context could not increase
further.

Specifically, we will conduct a laboratory experiment in which subjects make decisions regarding willingness to compete on behalf of themselves and on behalf of others.  Our willingness to compete measure follows closely the measure used in Neiderle and Vesterlund (2007). 
Subjects will be assigned (by session) to either make decisions on behalf of themselves first (control) or on behalf of a randomly-assigned subject in the same session first (treatment).  It warrants mention that when making decisions on behalf of another subject, the decision maker will know the gender of the person on whose behalf they are making the decision.  All subjects will make decisions both on behalf of themselves and others; the only difference between treatment and control groups is the order in which they make those decisions.  The study includes a second experimental intervention. Specifically, half of the subjects will be randomly-assigned to the ""skin in the game"" condition.  These subjects will receive 10 percent of the earnings of subject on whose behalf they make the decision if the payment task is a DMfO task.

Thus, the study is a 2 X 2 designed: DMfO first or DMfO second versus skin-in-the-game condition or no skin-in-the-game condition.  

This investigation of willingness to compete in DMfO is motivated by two policy-relevant factors. First, a popular explanation for gender differences in various academic and labor-market settings is a lack of mentorship for women. DMfO research can help understand the nature of mentor’s decisions. Second, sponsorship (giving mentors a stake in mentee’s outcomes) has been proposed as a policy to help close gender gaps. In an experiment similar to Niederle and Vesterlund, Baldiga & Coffman (2018) find that sponsorship only serves to increase the
competitiveness of the worst performing men, thereby increasing the gender gap in willingness to compete. In the Baldiga & Coffman experiment, though, sponsors did not make decisions on behalf of subjects, nor did they indicate in any way what they thought subjects should do; as such, the effect of DMfO, an important dimension of real-world mentorship/sponsorship relationships, has not been studied in this context.",,,,10/5/19,12/15/19,"Subjects' willingness to compete (and preference for competition) will be measured following the methods used in Neiderle and Vesterlund (2007).

The city of Nijmegen is one of these municipalities. In the regular welfare regime, the last safety net of the welfare state is social assistance: a means tested benefit for people who lack other income (for example for people who lose their job and whose unemployment benefits have ended, or refugees who are granted an official status). People who receive social assistance in the Netherlands are bound to strict obligations regarding reintegration in the labor market, and sanctions if they fail to live up to them. Under the experimental regime, social assistance recipients can be allowed to keep an amount of money, if they earn any in addition to their allowance. Further, the strict rules on reintegration can be loosened. The municipality created two combination treatments based on this, that differ substantially from the regular regime. The core difference is that the experimental treatments are based on giving recipients more autonomy and trust. This is expected to have a positive effect on labor market outcomes (work, part-time work, entrepreneurship), participation, health and well being. ",,,,12/1/17,1/1/20,"The municipality of Nijmegen chose for two combination treatments, in which a different approach to re-integration is coupled with the opportunity to earn extra money in addition to the social assistance payment. In the regular regime, people are allowed to keep 25% of the money they earn, up to a maximum of approximately 200 euro per month, for a maximum of six months during their entire social assistance spell. In the experimental treatment, participants are allowed to keep an extra during the entire duration of the experiment (22 months, from 1 December 2017 up to 1 October 2019), they can keep op to 50% of their earnings, up until the same maximum (approx. 200 euro). 
1)	The first treatment group is allowed to keep extra money from earnings. In addition, all obligations regarding reintegration are cancelled, as are the related fines for non-compliance. Obligations that are cancelled are  for example a minimum amount of job applications per week, the obligation to accept any job offer and the obligation to dress in an appropriate way when looking for work. If they want to, participants are allowed to ask for assistance of the local government or the regional re-integration organization in the search for a job.
2)	The second treatment group is allowed to keep extra money from earnings. In addition, a special re-integration trajectory has been designed for them. Participation in this trajectory is obligatory. All participants are divided in groups of 10-12 people, who receive a group coaching session every month, for the duration of the experiment. The personal goal of the treatment is set by the participants themselves, and can be either work, part-time work, entrepreneurship or voluntary work. The group coaching is designed to have participants first gain more insight in themselves (situation, wishes and possibilities), and only after that to give them more tools to present themselves (pitching, networking).
3)	The third group is the control group. These people applied for the experiment, but were randomized in the group that gets the same treatment as all other people on social assistance.
4)	Finally, all people who were eligible to participate but didn’t apply function as reference group on primary outcomes.

In the trial they received letters describing the differences between these regimes and a short explanation on expected differences in future pensions. Based on the literature and previous BI experiences, we expect that this intervention will increase the probability of choosing for the higher contribution option. We expect that the local average treatment effect will be positive among those who open the letter. The effect of different letter types will be also measured, and the difference between reactions on potential gains and losses will be also quantified.

From the perspective of taxpayers, the main benefits of this regime (beside lower compliance costs) are the significantly lower social security contributions compared to the regular income tax and social security regimes. However, these also result in lower social security benefits, including lower paid medical leave, unemployment insurance, and pensions.

Additionally, KATA taxpayers can also opt for a higher contribution of HUF 75,000 per month (approx. 260 USD) which raises expected pensions at retirement by 10-40%, depending on the age of the taxpayer. Currently this higher bracket is chosen by around 5% of the full time KATA taxpeyers.

To study common and important instances of fuzzy group membership, I propose two approaches: one based on notions of distance, and the other based on measuring subjective perceptions of group membership. Taking regions in Mexico as an example,  I use survey, field experiment and administrative data to test for regional bias in donations, in short-term migration, and in long-term migration. The bias appears only if region membership is conceptualized as fuzzy. Subjective perceptions provide the most consistent regionalization for capturing regional bias, and allow for testing several mechanisms.  First, national appeals and a stronger attachment to the nation diminish regional bias. Second, the way individuals draw regions  exacerbates regional inequality.

The donation petitions varied on two dimensions. The first dimension varied the state where the beneficiaries lived. There were six beneficiary states. The second dimension varied whether the donation petition  displayed the colors of the mexican flag on the frame of the donation petition card and on the name of the beneficiary state. ,,We randomized in a computer.,"We blocked on state and supermarket chain. Then we formed tuples based on the Mahalanobis ditance of the state's location, past sales and the supermerket size.

We clustered at the supermarket level. There were 2 types of cards in each supermarket. Although we randomized at the half-supermarket level, we randomized at the supermarket level as a conservative assumption. We ended up placing cards in only 440 supermarkets due to logistical complications. Only 330 supermarkets provided us with usable data, since some chains did not participate.","We planned for 1162 half-supermarkets, and ended up observing 660 half-supermarkets.","The assignment of cards from the supermarkets we were able to obtain data from (330 supermarkets) is a follows:

","Abstract: As cardiovascular diseases (CVD) become the leading cause of death in low- and middleincome countries (LMICs), this raises new challenges for health systems. Regular screening is a key measure against CVD risk factors, but the uptake of such services remains low despite free provision. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in Indonesia to assess whether personalized and targeted text messages increase the usage of public screening services for diabetes and hypertension in the at-risk population. Our intervention increased screening uptake by 6.6 percentage points. Among those who received and read the messages, the effect size was 17 percentage points. We show that text messages can be effective in a context of a relatively new disease burden in LMICs, where population responses may still be shaped by low salience and missing screening routines.

When such a policy is implemented, the affirmed group is not identifiable with certainty. We experimentally study how this feature affects the outcomes of affirmative action policies in a tournament context. In the baseline treatment, no affirmative action is implemented. In the gender quota treatment (GQ), affirmative action in the form of a gender quota makes the affirmed group (female) certainly identified. In the other treatment, a quota for both gender and a randomly assigned characteristic is applied in order to reduce the identity salience of females as an affirmed group. We test the difference in efficiency, willingness to compete, and partner selection in teamwork. ",,,,12/4/19,3/31/20,,"1. Proportions of affirmed and unaffirmed subjects entering the competition in Stage 3 and Stage 4.

",,"Individual performance under piece-rate incentives (stage 1), tournament incentives (stage 2 and stage 3), and in teamwork incentives (stage 5).",,"We applied affirmative action on the performance of an arithmetic task introduced by Niederle and Vesterlund (QJE, 2007), in which subjects have to add as many sets of five 2-digit numbers as possible in a given time. Measuring performance by the arithmetic task serves two purposes. First, no special knowledge is required, and minimal learning effect has been documented in previous studies. Second and more importantly, gender difference in willingness to compete is sensitive to the nature of the task. In particular, females are less competitive in mathematical tasks than males (Sutter et al. (EER, 2019)). Thus, by using an arithmetic task to measure performance, we introduce a reasonable need for gender quota favoring females in our setup. 

We implement a between-subject treatment design with three treatments. The baseline treatment (CTR) is without affirmative action. In the gender quota treatment (GQ), a gender quota is applied to favor female candidates, which makes the favored group identifiable with certainty. In the mix treatment (MIX), we use a set of criteria for affirmative action, including gender and a randomly assigned characteristic to reduce the salience of gender.

The experiment consists of five stages:

Stage 1: Piece rate. Subjects work on the task for five minutes and receive a piece-rate payment of 0.5 Euro per correct answer. 

Stage 2: Tournament. Subjects work on the same task as in stage 1, but under a tournament incentive. We randomly assign subjects to the Blue group and the Green group with equal probability. Each subject competes in a group of six, with three females and three males, three subjects from the Blue group and three from the Green group. Subjects stay in the same group in the following stages. Two winners are selected in each group. The winners earn 1.5 Euro per correct answer, while losers earn nothing. A random tie-breaking rule is applied in case of a tie. At the beginning of stage 2, subjects are informed about the group structure and their type. Subjects are not informed about the type of each group member. The result of the tournament is only informed at the end of the experiment. The treatments differ in how winners are selected:
-	Baseline treatment (CTR): winners are the two best performers.
-	Gender quotas (GQ): at least one of the winners must be female.
-	 Mix treatment (MIX): with 50% chance, a gender quota is applied - at least one of the winners must be female. With 50% chance, at least one of the winners must be from the Green group.

Stage 3: Self-selection into the tournament. Subjects choose whether they want to work under piece-rate incentives or tournament incentives before working on the task again. The rules of the tournament are the same as in stage 2. If a subject chooses the tournament in stage 3, her performance will be compared to the performance of her five fellow group members in stage 2. This feature ensures that beliefs about winning the tournament are similar in stages 2 and 3 (Niederle et al. (MS, 2013)).

Stage 4: Submit stage 1 score to either piece-rate or tournament. Subjects are asked to choose which scheme (piece-rate or tournament) they want to apply for their scores in Stage 1. If the tournament is chosen, their stage 1 score is compared with stage 1 score of the other five group members. The winners are then selected with the same rules and payoffs as in stage 2. If the piece-rate is chosen, subjects receive 0.5 Euro per correct answer in stage 1.

Stage 5: Partner selection in teamwork. Subjects move to a new working setup with a new gender-neutral task (Grid task, Abeler et al. (AER, 2011)). Before working, subjects are asked to team up with two of five subjects who used to be their group members in previous stages. Each group of three must include one leader and two employees. Leaders are two winners in stage 2, employers are the losers in stage 2. Subjects do not know about decisions on partner selection of others. The choice of partners of one subject does not affect the partner choice of others such that partner selection is an individual decision. Subjects then work on the Grid task for five minutes under a team incentive. The overall payoff of the team is equally shared among team members. Each correctly solved grid generates 0.6 Euro for the team and 0.2 Euro for each team member. In addition, the leader receives a bonus of 5 Euro, while each employee receives a bonus of 2 Euro.

A final questionnaire will include control variables such as overconfidence, risk preference, social preference and socio-economic background.

Although the forecast points to a general improvement of the Swedish labour market, the policy makers in Sweden are still facing some major challenges in how to tackle the increasing unemployment for certain groups in the society, such as the youths and the older population. Finding effective active labour market policy (ALMP) tools to tackle youth unemployment is important to mitigate “scarring” of young people (exposure to unemployment at the time of labour market entry has negative consequences for future earning.

1) Intensive individual personal meetings (one meeting every other week)
2) Intensive individual distance counselling (one contact every week)
3) Intensive group meeting (one meeting every week)

Individuals that are assigned into the control group take part of regular counselling activities at the PES. The intensity of these meetings differs for different groups of unemployed. As of today, there is one personal meeting on average with a caseworker every once in a month during the first three months of unemployment.

Meetings between caseworkers and the unemployed can have both monitoring and counselling functions and are important elements of ALMP. Unemployed workers first register their entry to unemployment in a first individual and personal meeting (face to face) at their local employment office. In later meetings, search efforts are monitored, counselling is given with referral to vacant jobs and eventual programme participations are discussed. Meetings may also help unemployed to maintain or increase their job search activities which in turn may lead to better job opportunities. Intensive meetings and increased knowledge about the unemployed can also influence the labour market's mode of operations, especially when the quality of the caseworkers’ direct job matching of unemployed and vacant jobs is high. 

The general picture from research is that there is a strong positive impact of frequent individual contacts between caseworkers and newly registered unemployed. However, frequent individual contacts require large resources for the Swedish PES who administrates these meetings. If the same positive effects of frequent contacts could be achieved through contacts via telephone or online or through group meetings, then a more efficient resource utilization at PES could be enhanced.

We intend to employ a two-level randomisation design with randomisation at local employment offices level as well as on individuals. This will also enable us to test for externalities on the untreated unemployed and to investigate whether the different kinds of meetings may have some general equilibrium effects. The literature on this is unfortunately very limited.","Evaluating the policy interventions, we focus on outcomes related to employment and measures of improved employability. Our main variable of interest is unemployment duration, i.e. to what degree the intervention reduces the number of days to employment. We will also estimate employment probabilities at certain intervals after 3, 5 and 12 months after the intervention. It is also important to explore the type of job (permanent, temporary, subsidised), for example to what extent the intervention increased the probability of getting unsubsidised full-time jobs. The probability of leaving unemployment for education as well as participation in other types of ALMPs will also be analysed. ",,"Indicators on individual’s job search activity, use of formal and informal search methods etc. will be explored. The probability of leaving unemployment for education as well as participation in other types of ALMPs will also be analysed.",,"The population from which the participants to the experiment will be sampled are all newly registered unemployed at the Swedish PES of age 18--64. Our total sample of eligible participants will be successively drawn during March 2015 to November 2015. This was inflow during 12 months in the original proposal, but changed to inflow during a short period due to practical restrictions at the Swedish Public Employment Service.

To test whether the early-stage ALMP interventions matters for newly unemployed, a randomized control trial design will be applied. To allow for evaluation of potential externalities on untreated unemployed, we will employ a two-level randomisation design with randomization at both the level of the local employment offices as well as the level of the individuals. In other words, we will first randomly decide the offices where the interventions will be implemented. Thereafter, newly registered unemployed individuals, at the offices selected for the experiments, will randomly be assigned to take part in the intervention (treatment group) or to be treated-as-usual (control group). 

In the first step, 72 local employment offices are randomized into taking part in the experiment. Among these 72 offices, 36 offices will be control office and the remaining 36 offices will randomized into each of the three interventions resulting in 12 offices for each experiment. To increase precision, the randomization of offices will be made within stratified groups. Here, we will make use of the cluster-model developed at the Swedish PES, sorting local employment offices into groups according to similarities in external factors such as characteristics of the local population and labour market. Randomisation will therefore take place within each cluster making sure that offices with similar characteristics end up both in the treatment and control group. 

To be able to test for displacement effects and to investigate whether the different kinds of interventions may have some general equilibrium effects, the 36 control offices will be used as comparison offices. 

In areas with more than one local employment office, displacement effects may not only exist for unemployed at the office where the intervention took place. Negative effects for individuals registered at neighboring local employment offices sharing the same local labour market therefore have to be considered not to underestimate the total magnitude of the displacement effects. To be able to isolate displacement effects for a given intervention, a necessary condition is that another type of intervention is not implemented in an office sharing the same local labour market. Randomization will therefore be performed under the restriction that only one type of intervention is implemented in each local labour market, for example by implementing the interventions in different geographical regions.",,"We have two-level randomisation design with randomization at both the level of the local employment offices (randomization by coin flip) as well as at the level of the individuals (randomization by date of birth (day of the year)).

First level: Randomizes 72 offices to 36 comparison offices, 12 offices with face-to-face meetings, 12 offices with distance meetings, and 12 offices with group meetings. 

Second level: within the 36 active offices randomizes 50% to treated and 50% to non-treated.",We have two-level randomisation design with randomization at both the level of the local employment offices and at individual level.,72 local public employment offices. ,"All newly registered unemployed at the 72 offices during March 2015 to November 2015 will be included in the experiment. A priori it is difficult assess the exact number of observations. Instead, the restricting factor is the experiment can take place at these 72 offices for a limited time period during 2015. A very low estimate from the original proposal was that we should have at least 11,500 participants.","36 comparison offices (5620 non-treated)
12 offices with face-to-face meetings (1875 treated, 1875 non-treated)
12 offices with distance meetings (1875 treated, 1875 non-treated)
12 offices with group meetings (1875 treated, 1875 non-treated)","We consider power calculations for the three treatments: face-to-face, distance and group meetings. For each treatment, all newly unemployed workers who satisfy the eligibility criteria will take part in the experiment. Below we show calculations based on a total sample size of 11,250 individuals, but we note that this is a conservative estimate, and we will use the full inflow at offices in the experiment in the analyses. 

With total sample size of 11,250 over 72 offices each treatment is expected to have 1875 individuals, of which 50% will be treated. Thus, for each treatment we have around 935 individuals in the treatment group and 935 individuals in the control group. 

The main outcome of interest is the job-finding rate. For the power calculations an average job-funding rate of 50%, i.e. we consider a binary outcome with mean equal to 0.5. We set in all power analyses the significance level to 5% and the power to 80%. 

This gives a minimum detectable effect size of 0.0648.

","Abstract: This paper uses a large-scale two-level randomized experiment to study direct and displacement effects of job search assistance. Our findings show that the assistance reduces unemployment among the treated, but also creates substantial displacement leading to higher unemployment for the non-treated. By using detailed information on caseworker and job seeker behavior we show that vacancy referrals passed on from caseworkers to job seekers is the driving mechanism behind the positive direct effect. We also examine explanations for the displacement effect and show that displacement is not due to constrained resources, but arises in the labor market. A comparison between different meeting formats suggests that face-to-face meetings and distance meetings are more effective than group meetings. Despite the existence of displacement effects, when we incorporate our results into an equilibrium search model we find that a complete roll-out of the program would lead to lower unemployment and slightly reduced government spending.

The over-prescription of antibiotics is a key driver of AMR. Unnecessary prescriptions are especially problematic in New Zealand, which had the 7th highest community prescription rate in the OECD in 2015. 

The Behavioural Insights Team's previous work in the UK has shown that a letter with personalised feedback to practices can reduce prescriptions of unnecessary antibiotics, and a recent replication in Australia by the Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government was even more effective by targeting individual General Practitioners (GPs). 

The current trial is being conducted by BIT, and draws on this prior work to tailor it to the New Zealand context. The trial aims to test whether personalised feedback to New Zealand GPs, in the form of a letter, can reduce prescriptions of unnecessary antibiotics. The trial will also test the impact on prescribing to Māori and Pacific patients, who tend to experience worse health outcomes. ",,,,8/19/19,12/31/19,"This trial contains two trial arms: the treatment group (who receive the letter intervention), and the control (who receive no letter intervention). 

The trial launched on 19 August 2019, with the one-off letters sent out, and prescribing behaviour will be analysed from September - December 2019. 

All high-prescribing GPs in the trial are stratified by area (District Health Board) before randomly allocating each GP to either the treatment group or the control group. ","There are two primary outcomes: 

1. Do the intervention letters reduce the prescribing rate of high-prescribing GPs? The prescribing rate is measured as the number of patients prescribed antibiotics per 100 patients prescribed any medicine, and is taken as the monthly average from September - December 2019.  

2. Do the intervention letters reduce the absolute number of antibiotics prescribed? This is measured as the number of antibiotic scripts dispensed from the doctors' prescribing, and is taken as a monthly average from September - December 2020. ",,"The secondary outcomes are listed below: 

1. Do the intervention letters reduce prescribing to Māori patients, to Pacific patients, and to non-Māori and non-Pacific patients? This will be measured as the prescribing rate (as defined in the first primary outcome measure) to Māori patients, to Pacific patients, and to non-Māori and non-Pacific patients.

2. Do the intervention letters change prescribing of paracetamol? This will be measured as the number of people prescribed paracetamol scripts per 100 prescribed any medicine. ",,"The intervention will be evaluated with a two-armed randomised controlled trial (RCT), with randomisation at the GP level and stratification by District Health Board (area). ",,"Randomisation in this trial is done using the 'stratified' function within the 'splitstackshape' package in R, to randomise GPs into the treatment or control arm within each stratum, ",Randomisation is at the GP level. ,This trial is not clustered. ,"There are 1,234 high-prescribing GPs in our sample, of whom 617 are sent the intervention letter. ",There are 617 GPs per trial arm. ,"We conduct power calculations to describe the relationship between the effect size, sample size, significance level and statistical power. This helps us to understand how many interventions we can test, and the minimum difference in the outcome measure that we can expect to be able to identify between arms.
We have described only the power calculation for our primary outcome measure - a GP’s antibiotic prescribing rate. 
Below we set out some assumptions which shape the calculations:
Significance level: 0.05
Power: 0.80
Number of participants: between 600 and 1,100 high-prescribing GPs in total, half of whom will receive the letter 
Baseline rate: Average AB rate 17.2 among high prescribers
Number of treatment arms: 1

If our total sample size is 1,100 GPs, we can detect an effect size of around 0.75 (a 4% decrease in the AB rate). 
We believe we are powered to detect realistic effect sizes. For example, the most effective intervention in the Australia trial reduced prescribing rates by 12.3% and was also targeted at individual GPs. ","Name: New Zealand Ethics Committee

proposed that focusing international climate negotiations on a uniform common
commitment (such as a uniform carbon price) ismore effective than negotiations on
individual commitments (as in the Paris agreement) in achieving ambitious climate
action. We put this hypothesis to an experimental test by simulating international
negotiations on climate change in collaboration with Model United Nations associations.
This novel experimental format combines some of the advantages of lab and
field experiments. Our results offer support for Weitzman’s hypothesis and indicate
that negotiating a common commitment on a uniform carbon pricemay yield higher
emission reductions in the long run and more participation than individual commitments
à la Paris.

We investigate how the quality of an agricultural technology – improved maize seed – affects its adoption. The research entails three hypotheses that will be tested in a series of randomized controlled trials among agro-input dealers and smallholder farmers in Uganda. In a first hypothesis, quality concerns that constrain uptake are caused by information inefficiencies at the level of the agro-input dealer, who is assumed to lack knowledge about proper storage and handling. An intensive training program is expected to increase improved maize seed quality and subsequent adoption by farmers. A second hypothesis conjectures that information asymmetry between seller and buyer with respect to the quality of seed – a classic lemons technology – leads to under-adoption. We implement a crowd-sourced information clearinghouse similar to yelp.com to test this hypothesis. This hypothesis targets the interaction between farmers and input dealers. A third hypothesis targets farmers directly, as sub-optimal adoption is assumed to be caused by learning failures: Farmers might attribute disappointing outcomes to poor input quality, while in reality many input dimensions like the time of planting, weeding and fertilizer application co-determine outcomes. An ICT-mediated information campaign that stresses the importance of paying attention to all input dimensions is implemented to test this hypothesis. ","Description: Github repo for the project

","Abstract: To fully benefit from new agricultural technologies like improved seed varieties, significant investment in complementary inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, and practices such as systematic planting, irrigation, and weeding are also required. Farmers may fail to recognize the importance of these complements, leading to unsatisfactory crop yields and outputs and, eventually, dis-adoption of the variety. We provide a simple model of biased expectations, complementary input use and technology adoption and test its predictions using a field experiment among smallholder maize farmers in eastern Uganda. We find that pointing out the importance of complementary investments using a short, engaging video effectively deters some farmers from using commercial improved varieties. Consistent with the theoretical model, we find some evidence that this behavior change emanates from increased knowledge and expectations that are more in line with realized outcomes.

Abstract: Recently, issues related to the (perceived) quality of inputs and technologies have been proposed as an important constraint to their adoption by smallholder farmers in low income countries. Taking maize seed embodying genetic gain as a case, we train random agro-dealers to test whether under-adoption by farmers is caused by low quality due to sellers' lack of knowledge about proper storage and handling. In a second hypothesis, we randomly introduce an information clearinghouse similar to popular crowd-sourced review platforms such as yelp.com or trustpilot.com to test whether information asymmetries crowd out quality seed. We find that the information clearinghouse treatment improves outcomes for both agro-dealers and farmers, with agro-dealers receiving more customers and reporting higher revenues from maize seed sales, and farmers reporting signicantly higher use of improved maize seed varieties obtained from agro-dealers, leading to higher maize productivity after two seasons. The primary mechanisms behind this impact appear to be an increased effort to signal quality by agro-dealers and a general restoration of trust in the market for improved seed. The agro-dealer training does not have a clear impact on agro-dealers, nor on farmers in associated catchment areas. However, we do find that the information clearinghouse increases agro-dealer knowledge about proper seed storage and handling. Upon exploring interaction effects between the training and the clearinghouse treatment, we also find that the training becomes effective for agro-dealers that are also in the clearinghouse treatment group. This underscores the importance of incentives to make supply side interventions such as trainings effective.

Measuring and tracking behaviour in the field is often a challenge. Wearable health-monitoring technology may offer innovative solutions for lifestyle modification, as well as the study of it. We want to understand how we can support diabetes patients form sustainable healthy-eating habits and increase glucose control. Our study is incorporating the behavioral changes that the COVID-19 pandemic may influence in this high risk population. It will be critical to understand the impact of the pandemic on this at risk population and to learn how we could better support the diabetic community to adapt to these changes. Better disease management will reflect a lower risk of co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease and severe COVID-19 illness. Overall, this research is highly relevant in the context of the global chronic disease burden, the COVID-19 pandemic, and preventing diabetes-related complications in particular.

",8/31/20,9/30/21,"This RCT will measure behavioral and health outcomes. The study employs a staircase design that will include three different treatment conditions. The three groups will vary in the amount of personalised feedback and healthcare practitioner contact they get. We aim to find out which treatment is the most helpful to diabetes patients to reach their diet and glucose control goals. All patients will receive an intervention which includes nutrition education, medical advice, and regular check ups with a study physician to monitor progress. We will also use health assessments, questionnaires, and mobile apps. 
","1. Percentage Time in Target Glucose Range (3.9 - 8 mmol/L) 
2. Haemoglobin A1c","1. To measure Percentage Time in Target Range we will use Abbott's Continuous Glucose Monitoring technology. We will use two different sensors: The Libre Pro and the FreeStyle Libre (with LibreLink app or scanner). The former provides no feedback, while latter provides real-time feedback to the wearer. To insert, the patient (or in our case, the nurse) lines up a disposable plastic applicator device with a spring-loaded needle on the back of the upper arm and pushes down. The spring-loaded needle introduces the sensor under the skin and retracts. The sensor is connected to a small round external disc and held in place with a water resistant adhesive, where it remains for 14 days. The technology allows for readings of real-time glucose values with the scanner or the LibreLink smartphone app, as well as visual trends and variability (e.g. Time in Target). The study facilitator will assist the patient to log in to the LibreLink app. The FreeStyle Libre sensor is factory calibrated. In order for glucose data to be stored, the wearer must flash over the device with their scanner or smartphone at least once every 8 hours. The LibreLink app is compatible with NFC-enabled smartphones running Android OS 5.0 or higher and with iPhone 7 and higher running OS 11 and higher. There is also a scanner available as an alternative to using the mobile app.

2. Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is recognised as the key surrogate marker for the development of long-term diabetes complications and has been used as the primary endpoint for many CGM studies. While HbA1c reflects average glucose over the past 2-3 months, its limitation is the lack of information about acute glycaemic excursions and the acute complications of hypo- and hyperglycaemia (colloquially, “glucose spikes”). HbA1c fails to show the magnitude and frequency of intra- and interday glucose variation. The utility of HbA1c measures are enhanced when used as a complement to CGM glycaemic data. A blood sample will be taken to test HbA1c at baseline and endline. This test is standard in diabetes diagnosis and management. It would be ordered regularly, even in the absence of our study. ","1. Diet adherence 
2. Lipid panel
3. Body composition
4. Blood pressure
5. Subjective wellbeing
6. Diabetes distress score","1. Two dietary assessment tools will be used to characterize subjects’ diets. A Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and a Medicross paper food diary for diabetes patients. 
First, at Visit 1, participants will complete a self-administered FFQ (Appendix C) asking about foods eaten in the past month. The instrument has been used in previous studies in South Africa and can also be used online (Webster, Murphy, Larmuth, Noakes and Smith, 2018). The FFQ was developed according to guidelines proposed by Cade, Thompson, Burley, & Warm (2002) by adapting the South African Medical Research Council’s (MRC) FFQ (Steyn & Senekal, 2004) to include food items frequently eaten by people following a low carbohydrate diet. It also includes standard portion sizes (to increase accuracy of macronutrient ratio estimation), and frequency options (necessary for an online questionnaire). The FFQ data will be used to assess the types of foods eaten and macronutrient ratios rather than absolute nutrient quantities. Macronutrient ratios will be determined from FFQ data by multiplying the frequency of food items eaten per month, by their respective assigned macronutrient contents. Macronutrient content will be derived from the FatSecret database and MRC’s SAFOODS database, because MRC’s SAFOODS database omits many low carbohydrate food choices. The FFQ will be re-administered (Visit 5) to assess the sustainability of healthy-eating habits formed during the intervention. 
	Second, participants will be asked to keep a food diary for four days during the beginning of the baseline and four days towards the end of the CGM intervention. The four days will include weekends and weekdays.  We are interested in quality over quantity of data so we do not insist on daily entries. However, patients may enter the diary daily if they wish. Besides the common limitations of self-report measures (e.g. deception, guessing, non-compliance), there is a risk of missing data when asking individuals to enter their food intake since they could forget or become fatigued. Omissions in the food diary will be followed up on. We will also learn from compliance rates in entering data about the usefulness of such diaries as a measure of self-reported dietary intake. For the treatment groups, it will be interesting to correlate compliance behaviours such as number of food diary days completed and number of scans per day using Freestyle Libre CGM (engagement in self-monitoring). Qualitative comparisons will be discussed between temporal glucose patterns and reported dietary intake. Our analysis of participants’ food choices will be explorative. 

2. Lipid panel will be measured at baseline and endline (blood test).

3-4. Body composition (including waist and hip circumference, weight, height) and blood pressure will be taken at baseline and regular checkups with study physician.

5-6. The participant will complete a self-administered baseline questionnaire to assess demographics (including income bracket and education), tobacco and alcohol consumption, physical activity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and blood pressure history, risk and time preferences, math ability, subjective wellbeing, and diabetes distress. Our baseline questionnaire includes sections from validated questionnaires. Prevalence and severity of diabetes is strongly associated with socioeconomic and cultural factors, such as income, education, gender, ethnicity and culture. Subjective wellbeing and diabetes distress will be measured at baseline and endline. 
           Subjective wellbeing will be measured using a single standard item and scored on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 means “very dissatisfied” and 10 means “very satisfied”: “How do you feel about your life as a whole right now?”. The wording of this standard measure of subjective wellbeing is sourced from the South African National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS). This measure may be affected by social distancing and economic hardship due to SARS-CoV2 restrictions, which will be recorded.
	We will use the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) for adults with type 2 diabetes. The DDS is a 17-item self-report instrument. Each item is rated on a 6-point scale from (1) “not a problem” to (6) “a very significant problem”. The scale yields an overall distress score based on the average responses on the 1-6 scale for all 17 items. It can also be used to get a measure of emotional burden (average of 5 items), physician distress (average of 4 items), regimen distress (average of 5 items) and interpersonal distress (average of 3 items). Average score < 2.0 reflects little or no distress. Average score 2.0 – 2.9 reflects moderate distress and > 3.0 reflects high distress. A total or subscale score > 2.0 is considered clinically significant.","This RCT will measure behavior change and health outcomes. We will explore which type of feedback and support is most useful to patients with type 2 diabetes to fine tune their diet and help them reach their metabolic health goals. We will use a rolling recruitment strategy and sequential assignment to treatments. Eligible adult type 2 diabetes patients will be referred to the study physicians by the network of physicians at a medical centre in South Africa. The investigators will make use of remote monitoring technology as far as possible to limit the need for person-to-person contact. We will explore the influence of the pandemic on patients' ability to manage their diabetes.
","There are three distinct phases to this project. Briefly, phase 1 includes the informed consent and baseline procedures, as well as assignment to one of the three treatment groups. Phase 2, is the major intervention phase with two different CGMs (FreeStyle Libre flash and the Libre Pro sensor) and health coaching.  Phase 3 entails the follow-up and sustainability assessment section. We will conduct a behavioural experiment to evaluate the effect of near real-time feedback from the FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitor alone, or in combination with online health coaching, on blood glucose levels and diet adherence. The target population will be adult men and women, age 30 - 65 years, with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 6.5 - 11%, not using insulin, and able to speak English and understand English. The sample size will be 90 participants. Eligible individuals will be recruited through the network of 13 physicians at Kenilworth Medicross Medical Centre, and referred to the study physicians for the 3-month period of the trial. During baseline (Phase 1), blinded CGM data (using the Libre Pro sensor) will be collected from all participants to record usual dietary habits and baseline glucose patterns. At the same time dietary data will be collected. Next, the study physicians will review the patient’s CGM data after baseline and give dietary advice to the patient (Phase 2). This is the standard low carbohydrate high fat dietary advice for diabetes used in the study physicians’ practice. All patients will receive the same dietary advice and set a goal to bring their HbA1c below 6.5% and their time in target range (3.9 - 8 mmol/L) to 70% or more by restricting carbohydrates to less than 25g per day. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups (CONTROL, INFORMATION, or COACHING). We use a staircase design.
The CONTROL will only receive intermittent feedback on glucose patterns from the consulting physician during study visits (while wearing the Libre Pro). The CONTROL may continue their standard finger prick glucose self-monitoring. In contrast to the two treatment groups, the CONTROL will not have access to real-time glucose patterns from the FreeStyle Libre mobile app. The two treatment groups (INFORMATION and COACHING) will wear a factory calibrated FreeStyle Libre sensor and use the mobile app which allows for real-time glucose self-monitoring without finger prick testing. In addition to real-time glucose information from the FreeStyle Libre sensor and app, COACHING participants will have regular appointments online with a certified health coach. Subject will complete a food diary during both baseline (four days) and intervention (four days). ","We will randomize sequentially, as patients are enrolled on a rolling basis at the medical practice, using a computer and Stata statistical software.  ",Individual,90 individuals and three treatment arms.,90 individuals.,"30 individuals CONTROL (physician standard care), 30 individuals INFORMATION (physician standard care plus CGM real-time feedback), 30 individuals COACHING (physician standard care plus CGM real-time feedback and health coaching online).","Individuals will be sequentially randomly assigned and matched for sex and carbohydrate intake to one of the three groups, during phase 1, until a sample size of 30 participants per group is achieved. We have repeated observations for all participants during baseline, intervention and sustainability phases.
The number of participants was chosen based on power calculations (default significance level alpha 0.05, power 0.80) using the free software G*Power for statistical power analysis (Faul, F., Erdfelder, E., Lang, A. et al., 2007). We also took budget and logistical factors into consideration. We aim to be able to detect a clinically significant change in our primary behaviour of interest (5% Time in Target (3.9 - 8 mmol/L)) and in our primary health outcome (HbA1c of 0.5%). We aim to do both a within-subject (before and after) and between subject experimental analysis. However, it is likely that the sample size will limit us to a within-subject analysis and difference-in-difference analysis. Difference-in-difference analysis will allow for the comparison of the treatment against the control group (Wing, Simon and Bello-Gomez, 2018). This is a quasi-experimental research design that will allow us to study causal relationships if a classical randomized control trial design is not feasible.      
A within-subject analysis considers a t-test using measurements before and after treatment. We set G*Power to calculate the difference between two sample means (matched pairs). An a priori type of power analysis computes the required sample size, given significance level alpha, power, and effect size. We use the default significance level alpha 0.05 and power 0.80. We consider a one-tailed t-test because the hypothesis we have is that compared to baseline the outcome improves with the behavioural intervention. The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference from baseline. We use the Wilcoxon signed rank test which relaxes the assumption of t-tests that the data are normally distributed (parent distribution min ARE). For HbA1c, we consider the sample size necessary to detect a difference in mean HbA1c from 7.3% to 6.3% (i.e. a clinically significant difference of 1.0 as observed in a previous health coaching study McKenzie et al., 2017) with standard deviation (SD) of 3.5 before treatment and standard deviation of 2.0 after (standard deviations based on clinical experience of the study physicians). Since both measures are from the same individual the correlation between them is high (0.95). Using these values, the standardized effect size (dz) is 0.58. G*Power output states that a total sample size of 23 participants is necessary to detect this effect size. For Time in Target range, we consider the required sample size necessary to detect a small improvement from 50% to 55% with SD of 20 before treatment and SD of 15 after. This produces an effect size (dz) of 0.67. G*Power states that we require a sample size of 18 participants to detect a small clinically significant improvement in Time in Target range. Since we will recruit 30 participants within each group, the study is adequately and conservatively powered for within-subjects analysis of treatment effect for both primary outcome measures HbA1c and Time in Target range. 
The between-subjects a priori power analysis in G*Power considers a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (two groups) to test for a treatment effect i.e. treatment group versus control group. For HbA1c, if we consider the case of the control group with mean 7.0 and SD 2.0 and the treatment group with mean 6.0 and SD 2.0, this is an effect size (d) of 0.5 and requires a sample size of 101 subjects in each of the two groups. We will have only 30 subjects in each group and thus will not be able to detect a small to moderate effect size of treatment on HbA1c with these assumptions. Turning to a post hoc power analysis we consider what effect size we could actually achieve with 30 subjects in each group. G*Power states that we can detect an effect of 0.71 with our proposed design. For HbA1c we would be able to detect a difference of about 1.5 pp (e.g. control 7.5% (SD 2) versus treatment group 6.0% (SD 2)), which would be somewhat unlikely to observe in the data. However, SD greatly affects these estimates of power. Balancing the groups on sex and baseline carb intake will help to reduce the SD. The possibility of between-subjects analysis of HbA1c will only be known after we have collected the data. 
We continue the hypothetical post hoc power analysis for Time in Target range in G*Power. If we consider the case of the control group with mean 60% (SD 15) and treatment group with mean 70% (SD 15), this is an effect size of 0.67 and power of 0.76 (just below default threshold of adequate statistical power). However, if control SD is 14 and treatment group SD is 14, this implies an effect of 0.71 and adequate power of 0.81. Thus, with smaller SDs the study would in this case be powered to detect a clinical difference of 10% between treatment and control group in our primary behavioural outcome. Overall, we expect the study will have adequate statistical power for a within-subjects analysis, and potentially between-subjects analysis for Time in Target.

Such services provided by governments are characterised by their non-excludability: once they are in place, all individuals, irrespective of whether they contributed towards it or not, will be able to use them. This leaves room for opportunistic behaviour that is widely studied in public good game studies and ways in which the free-rider problem can be overcome. What happens when citizens believe the government or administration responsible for collecting taxes is corrupt and may embezzle these funds? This would naturally reduce the provision of such services, as lower funds will be available from the governing body. Do taxpayers use this possibility as an ‘excuse’ to reduce even further their contributions towards public goods? We design an experiment to study the extent to which such moral wiggle room may re-inforce the inefficiencies of corruption. By contrasting public good games with or without embezzlement of contributions, we aim to identify whether individuals hide behind ignorance about the efficacy of the public good when choosing to contribute towards it.

GiveDirectly recently conducted a pilot in Kyaka II Settlement in Uganda. Cash transfers were provided to 4,371 refugee and host community households. An internal evaluation of the pilot concluded that the transfer had positive indicative results and was operationally feasible. The project in Kiryandongo will build on the pilot by conducting a larger and more rigorous independent study. The impact evaluation of the transfer will be conducted by IDinsight and consists of a randomized control trial (RCT) with refugee households, a cross-sectional study with host recipients, and a longitudinal qualitative study with both refugee and host community households. The mixed methods approach will examine the impact of the cash transfers by carefully identifying what changed as well as why and how the change happened. Results of the program will inform future decision-making regarding cash transfers by donors and implementing organizations.

IDinsight will answer the following research questions in this evaluation: 
1) What is the impact of large, unconditional cash transfers on refugee households for outcomes such as income, assets, consumption, enterprise, food security and psychological well-being?
2) What do any changes caused by the cash transfers mean for the lives of refugee households and how did those changes come about?
3) What is the effect of cash transfers on host communities, and the relationship between host and refugee communities?

",,,2/10/20,4/30/20,"GiveDirectly is an international nonprofit that implements unconditional cash transfer programs directed at communities living in extreme poverty. GiveDirectly implements a range of transfer designs across its projects, including one-off amounts that roughly equal the annual income of poor households. To ensure the integrity of the process, GiveDirectly employs a set of independent checks to verify that recipients meet the eligibility criteria and were not asked to pay bribes during the selection process.

GiveDirectly aims to understand the role of unconditional cash transfers as one possible route to improving the self-reliance of refugees in protected displacement contexts. The program intends to provide around USD$1000 in unconditional cash transfers to all of the ~10,000 refugee households in Kiryandongo Refugee Settlement and about 5,000 host community households in Kiryandongo district, Uganda.

UNHCR estimates indicate that there are around 1.4 million refugees in Uganda. Many of the forcibly displaced people are expected to remain in Uganda over the long-term given the prolonged character of the conflicts in their countries of origin. The expected long-term stay and progressive refugee policies in Uganda designate the country as an appropriate setting to analyze the lasting impacts of cash transfers.","The primary outcome is the economic well-being of our households. This will be measured using three primary indicators:
1) Household consumption, 2) Household assets (including savings and loans), and 3) Agricultural and non-agricultural business revenue","1) Household consumption: This indicator measures the total monthly value of household consumption and spending including food consumption, consumption of temptation goods, and spending on non-food items. Specifically, the indicator will be constructed as follows:
a) Sum of food consumed by the household at home and away from home in the last 7 days, multiplied by 4.3 to obtain a monthly value, b) sum of temptation goods (alcohol, tobacco, lottery and gambling) consumed by the household at home and away from home in the last 7 days, multiplied by 4.3 to obtain a monthly value, c) sum of frequent non-food spending in the last 7 days (e.g., fuel and transport, etc.), multiplied by 4.3 to obtain a monthly value, d) sum of frequent non-food spending in the last 4 weeks (e.g., water, rent, etc.), divided by 4 and multiplied by 4.3 to obtain a monthly value, and e) sum of infrequent non-food spending in the last 12 months (e.g., clothing, education expenses and taxes, etc.), divided by 12 to obtain a monthly value. 
All total values are added, divided by the World Bank’s 2018 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) and United States Dollar (USD) Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) conversation rate, and winsorized at the top 1%.

2) Household assets (including savings and loans): The assets indicator estimates the total current market value of common moveable and unmoveable household assets (including livestock), savings and the net balance of currently outstanding loans given and taken. All total values are added, divided by the World Bank’s 2018 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) and United States Dollar (USD) Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) conversation rate, and winsorized at the top 1%.

3) Agricultural and non-agricultural business revenue: This indicator measures the total monthly revenue from all formal and informal enterprises fully or partially owned by any household member including agricultural (based on crops sold) and non-agricultural business revenue. Monthly agricultural revenue is calculated by collecting total agricultural revenue from the six months prior to the survey and dividing by six. The total revenue from all agricultural and non-agricultural businesses are divided by the World Bank’s 2018 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) and United States Dollar (USD) Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) conversation rate, and winsorized at the top 1%.
","We will investigate the following supplementary outcomes to understand other aspects of welfare: 1.1) Psychological well-being, 1.2) Food security, 1.3) Female empowerment, 1.4) Business ownership, 1.5) Employment status of survey respondent, 1.6) Migration, and 1.7) Household composition. We will also explore two community level outcomes as part of the study, including: 2.1) Social cohesion, and 2.2) Safety and security.
","1.1) Psychological well-being: This individual-level outcome variable is based on a composite index following the procedure proposed by Anderson (2008) and adapted from Haushofer and Shapiro (2016). It comprises the standardized weighted average of the following components: a) The total score of ten elements of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D scale), which surveys the frequency of different types of feelings among respondents, b) the total score of the four elements of the Cohen’s stress scale, c) the numerical responses to the World Value Survey's sections that focus on happiness and life satisfaction, and d) the total score from a thirteen-element-custom-worries questionnaire. All components are coded in a way that higher values represent higher levels of well-being.

1.2) Food security: The food security index is a standardized weighted index which measures the number of days in the last seven days that adults and children: skipped or cut meals; went entire days without food; and went to bed hungry. It also includes the number of meals eaten yesterday that contained protein. Responses are appropriately signed so that higher values represent better food security. The index is taken from Egger et al. (2019) to allow comparability across GiveDirectly projects. 

1.3) Female empowerment: This individual-level composite index comprises the standardized weighted average of a time-use measure that captures the proportion of hours spent on household and care work by female respondents on the day before the survey (negatively coded), the proportion of school-aged girls enrolled in school, and the average number of days school-aged girls attended school in the last five days when school was open. School-aged girls are between 6 and 18 years old. The index is created using the inverse-covariance weighting technique of Anderson (2008). 

1.4) Business ownership: This indicator is based on a binary variable that takes the value 1 if the respondent's household has one or more businesses as of endline date.

1.5) Employment status of survey respondent: This individual-level outcome measures whether the survey respondent is in formal or informal employment or self-employment. This is measured for households with a working-age (15-64) respondent. 

1.6) Migration: These outcomes measure the actual migration pattern of the household. We measure the number of household members who have migrated out of the settlement since baseline, and number of household members who have migrated into the settlement since baseline. 

1.7) Household composition: This outcome measures the size of households and the dependency ratio as scattered sub-outcomes: a) Household size: Total number of household members, and b) Dependency ratio: ratio of dependents – people younger than 15 or older than 64 – to the working aged population (ages 15-64). 

2.1) Social cohesion: Community level data is collected about relationships within the refugee settlement and also among refugees and host communities. This composite index is based on a custom social cohesion questionnaire covering a subjective rating of the relationships for different groups of interest (refugee-host relations, inter-refugee relations, and intra-family relations) and the self-reported frequency of disputes between refugee and host communities. It is coded in a way that higher values represent higher levels of social cohesion.

2.2) Safety and security: This composite index is based on a custom safety and security questionnaire covering self-reported incidences of crimes experienced by the respondent’s household, a worries scale about crime and safety in the community, and perception of crime and conflict levels in the community. It is coded in a way that positive values represent higher levels of safety and security. ","The study has three major parts: 1) A randomized control trial will be used to measure the causal impact of the cash transfers for refugees, 2) A longitudinal qualitative study to examine how and why change does (or doesn’t) take place in refugee and host community households, and 3) An observational study will examine cash transfer recipients from the host community.

The mixed methods approach will examine the impact of the cash transfers by carefully identifying what changed as well as why and how the change happened. Results of the program will inform future decision-making regarding cash transfers by donors and implementing organizations. This pre-analysis plan primarily relates to the randomized control trial. Details regarding the analysis approach for the longitudinal qualitative study can be found in the attached, more detailed analysis plan.

The randomized control trial will use a phased-in design. Under GiveDirectly’s program, eligible households in the refugee settlement have been divided into 24 cohorts through a public lottery (see ‘Assignment method’ below). Cash transfers will be distributed by cohort, with cohort 1 receiving its cash transfers in the first, cohort 2 receiving its cash transfer second etc. Cohorts are expected to be phased-in on a monthly basis, though in practice operational factors will cause some deviations from the planned schedule. For the randomized control trial’s phased-in design, the treatment group will consist of households in cohorts 1, 2, and perhaps 3. The control group is households in cohorts 17-20.
The timing of this study overlaps with the global COVID-19 pandemic of 2019-2020. The first transfers to our treatment group took place in late February 2020. On March 30, Uganda’s president ordered a nationwide lockdown, which restricted almost all movement and commerce throughout the country. This had an immediate effect on livelihoods in Kiryandongo, as many members in the settlement make money by traveling for casual labor or through running small enterprises. Therefore, the study will provide evidence as to the efficacy of cash transfers in the context of the COVID crisis.",,"The sampling frame will be built on data provided by UNHCR which encompasses information on all (~10,000) registered refugee households living in Kiryandongo. UNHCR and GiveDirectly have identified around 1005 households as PSN (persons with specific needs), who will receive the cash transfer first but will not be a part of the study. The remaining 8886 non-PSN refugee households were placed in a public lottery for random assignment into one of 24 cohorts. The lottery was conducted during the World Food Programme’s (WFP) monthly food and cash distributions in August 2019. The lottery was run publicly to ensure transparency and buy-in of the community. This approach was recommended by community leaders. 

During the lottery, each household was given the opportunity to draw a cohort number. A household representative drew a single number from a bucket containing 24 ping-pong balls labeled 1 to 24. The number that each refugee picked corresponds to their assigned cohort number. After each draw, the ping-pong ball was returned into the bucket for the next participant. This lottery with replacement approach was chosen to ensure that each respondent had the same chance of picking a number between 1 and 24. 

574 households that did not attend food and cash distribution were randomized in a separate public event, during which community leaders picked the cohort number on behalf of those remaining households.

One of the limitations of this large public lottery randomization process came from the practical challenge of ensuring no tampering from interested groups. The early cohorts 1 and 2 together comprise 9.56% of the non-PSN settlement population, compared to the expected value of 8.33% (2/24) and are thus over-represented. The later cohorts of 23 and 24, on the other hand, together represent 7.5% of the lotterized households and are thus under-represented by 0.83% compared to the expected value of 8.33%.  These differences from the expected value are statistically significant at p<0.01, indicating some tampering with the lottery process. Our control cohorts (17 to 20) together represent 16% of the non-PSN settlement population, compared to the expected value of 16.67%. The difference is not statistically significant (p=0.0886). Despite these disappointing findings from the lottery, we believe we can still achieve credible results given the limited magnitude of tampering and the ability to control for some of the differences.","The treatment and control groups have been constructed by a random allocation of refugee households through the public lottery. Randomization will happen at the household level. For the purposes of this study, a household is defined as a group of individuals who have registered as a single household under the UNHCR/OPM system.",Design not clustered,"The treatment group consists of refugee households in cohorts 1 and 2 who will have received their cash transfer before the endline survey (note that we may add some households from cohort 3 to the treatment group if non-compliance or attrition cause statistical power to dip to unacceptable levels). The control group consists of a random sample of households from cohorts 17-20 who will have not yet received their cash transfer at the endline survey. There are no additional criteria beyond being a GiveDirectly cash transfer recipient, the assignment to treatment timing through GiveDirectly’s public randomization, and the ability and willingness to provide informed consent to participate in the study.

Prior to the lottery process, we planned to sample approximately 1500 households (750 treatment, 750 control). This would have resulted in a minimal detectable effect size (MDES) of 0.145 SDs with 80% power. This effect size is less than the 0.18 SD effect of business revenue observed in a previous GiveDirectly evaluation (Haushofer and Shapiro 2016). IDinsight has powered the study on business outcomes, as the smallest effect size is expected for business outcomes compared to other outcomes of interest. 

During baseline data collection, IDinsight learned that some physical households will receive more than one cash transfer. This is because cash transfers will be made based on a list of households as registered with UNHCR. However, the group of people that live together and the “household” registered with UNHCR are not always the same. This would be problematic for the study as some of our control households live with family members who will receive a cash transfer before our endline survey, essentially meaning these control households will be treated. Such “spillover” households in the control group, as well as equivalent households from the treatment group, were therefore dropped from the study. As a result of both the issue of multiple transfers per household and challenges locating some of the sampled households, our sample size dropped to 1264 at baseline.","642 households in the treatment group, and 622 households in the control group.",The sample size of 1264 will yield an MDES of 0.16 Standard Deviations (SD).,"Name: Mildmay Uganda (MUREC)

","Abstract: Refugees in protracted displacement are often limited in their opportunities for income-generating activities and investments, making them dependent on aid for meeting basic needs. In the context of stretched humanitarian aid budgets, it is a necessary policy question to determine ways to increase refugees’ self-reliance. In this study, we combine a randomized controlled trial with extensive longitudinal qualitative data to explore the multidimensional impacts of a large, one-time, unconditional transfer of 1,000 USD to households of predominantly South Sudanese refugees living in protracted displacement in Uganda. Estimated after 19 months, we find that the transfer significantly increased households’ consumption, asset values, business ownership, business revenue, psychological well-being, and self-reliance. We find positive but insignificant effects on food security, migration, employment, or female empowerment. Overall, a large one-time cash transfer given in the context of shocks has multidimensional improvements in refugees’ lives, providing meaningful movement towards self-reliance.

Abstract: Objectives: In this paper, we estimate the impact after 4–8 months of a large one-off unconditional cash transfer delivered to refugees during a time of dual shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic and cuts to monthly aid. We focus on four key outcomes: (1) health-seeking behaviour; (2) COVID-19 specific preventive health practices; (3) food security and (4) psychological well-being.

Methods: We use both quantitative and qualitative data to understand the impact of a cash transfer in this context. Quantitatively, we use a baseline survey of 1200 households (Q4 2019) and follow-up with three rounds of phone surveys in Q2 and Q3 2021, capturing at least half the sample in each round. We exploit an experimental variation in the timing of the cash transfer to assess the effect of the cash transfer through ordinary least squares regressions of intention to treat. Controlling for key baseline characteristics, we analyse the effect of the cash transfer on health access, COVID-19 health practices, food security and psychological well-being. Qualitatively, we make use of a longitudinal, small-n sample of refugee respondents, each of whom we interviewed up to 15 times between February and September 2020 to understand change over time and to go deeper into key topics.

Results: We do not find a statistically significant effect (6.2%, p=0.188) of receiving the cash transfer on preventative measures against COVID-19. However, households receiving the cash transfer were more food secure, with a 14.4% (p=0.011) improvement on the food security index, have better psychological well-being (24.5%, p=0.003) and are more likely to seek healthcare in the private health facilities (10.4%, p=0.057) as compared with control households. We do not find significant results on the value of food consumption. Overall, we find stronger treatment effects for households that were the first to receive the cash transfers.

Conclusion: Taken together, we find significant support for the importance of cash transfers to refugee households mitigating against declines in food security and mental well-being in the face of shocks.

We find the information treatments do not affect support, but the argument treatments significantly increase support for three of the policies. We also include a behavioral measure by allowing respondents the opportunity to write their U.S. Senators. We find argument treatments significantly increase the likelihood that letters address economic mobility and significantly promote advocacy for that policy in the letter, but no increase in advocacy from the information treatments.",,,,4/8/19,4/12/19,,"1. the difference in support (measured by a 5-point likert scale pre- and post-intervention) at the individual level

5. whether that letter mentioned, supported, or opposed each of the policies discussed in the intervention above
",,,,"We posted the survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) with a description stating that the survey would take roughly 10 minutes, and respondents would receive $1.50 for completing the survey (a $9.00 hourly wage, approximately). Respondents were free to drop out at any time or take up to 24 hours to work on all the questions. We restricted our sample to those workers Amazon has verified as U.S. residents. We did not, however, choose to work with only “masters qualified” mTurk workers to avoid frequent (if otherwise reliable) survey experiment participants in favor of less experienced respondents.  We launched our survey during U.S. business hours to discourage ineligible international respondents. Respondents only receive payment contingent upon completing the survey and are required to provide a unique password that is only visible at completion. Finally, aside from the voluntarily answered question on whether to write a letter to their U.S. Senator, we required subjects to answer all questions, and pop-up windows reminded them to complete all questions in each section before continuing.

Our experimental design includes eight treatments (two “information” treatments and six “argument” treatments) and a control condition. In all of these, respondents begin by indicating whether they favor or oppose six policies that one or more political actors (elected official or advocacy groups) have linked to improving economic mobility. These six polices are: 1) raising the minimum wage, 2) increasing cash assistance to the poor, 3) providing housing vouchers to move poor people into middle class neighborhoods, 4) universal pre-kindergarten, 5) marriage tax credits to encourage two-parent families for children, and 6) reducing immigration (both legal and illegal). These are not necessarily policies developed by economists nor found to be effective to promote intergenerational economic mobility, but have been framed in terms of current or intergenerational mobility by one or more political entrepreneurs.  Following these questions, respondents are randomly assigned into one of the nine conditions.

The information treatments—Relative and Absolute—use a short interactive task to elicit respondents’ beliefs about either relative mobility or absolute mobility, respectively, though they do not elicit any information on the respondents themselves. The Relative task asks respondents to indicate what fraction of children born in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution in the 1980s end up in each income quintile as an adult today, and also what fraction of children born in the top 20 percent end up in each income quintile today. The Absolute task, in contrast, asks respondents to estimate what fraction of children born in each income quintile in the 1980s earn more today than their parents earned when the children were born. Following the respondents’ guesses, we show them how their estimates compare to the actual data from Chetty et al. (2014) for relative mobility and Chetty et al. (2017) for absolute mobility, with the data presented both textually and graphically.

In addition to the two information treatments, we have six argument treatments. Each treatment is an explicit argument for one of the six policies styled similarly to how proponents of that policy tie it to economic mobility or poverty reduction in policy briefs, op-eds, or speeches, alongside a graphical presentation of evidence for the policy drawn from policy entrepreneurs’ arguments. Note that we are not claiming these policies will have the effect of increasing social mobility or decreasing income inequality. Rather, there are proponents of these policies who have framed arguments for each policy in these terms, and we have adapted their arguments and evidence into six treatments. Each of these treatments is similar to the argument for the estate tax in Kuziemko et al. (2015), except that the accompanying visual is always a graph (rather than, e.g., a picture) and the accompanying argument is always framed in terms of increasing social mobility. All treatments are standardized for length (between 159 and 162 words, about the length of a typical abstract).

To ensure that it is the content of each treatment, and not the type of activity (interactive guessing or reading arguments) or the length of time that drives the result, we pair each information treatment (Relative and Absolute) with a placebo argument and each argument treatment with a placebo interactive information task. Following Nickerson’s (2008) use of recycling as a “placebo” (as opposed to an uncontacted control group), we also employ an argument for recycling as a placebo argument for the two information treatments. Similarly, we use an interactive information task about recycling as a placebo for the six argument treatments (specifically, subjects guess what fraction of various products, like lead batteries or newsprint, are recycled). We chose recycling as a relatively “neutral” issue, both on the basis of Nickerson (2008) and of its overwhelming popularity across partisan lines (Pew Research Center 2009), though other survey evidence shows a partisan divide on recycling consistent with differences in the parties toward environmental issues generally (Coffey and Joseph 2013). To ensure consistency in terms of the order of activities, each treatment begins with an interactive task and ends with an argument.",,Randomization done by a computer (Qualtrics-provided randomization into treatment).,Individual respondent,No clustering. 1 control and 8 treatments.,"2,400 individuals",~260 individuals per treatment arm (and control),,,,4/12/19,True,4/12/19,2399 individuals,False,2399 individuals,"267 Control, 266 Absolute, 263 Relative, 267 Minimum Wage, 268 Cash Assistance, 266 Housing Voucher, 268 Universal Pre-K, 269 Marriage Tax Credit, 265 Less Immigration",False,,False,,"

","Abstract: I conduct an online experiment to test whether negative emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic impair labor productivity. Subjects are exposed to a worry-amplifying or worry-alleviating media report before working on a cognitively demanding mental arithmetic task for a piece-rate wage. The treatment manipulation induces a multi-faceted negative emotional response, comprising an increase in worry and a decrease in happiness, but does not meaningfully reduce subsequent productivity. Nontheless, I find suggestive evidence of changes in cognition: exposure to the worry-amplifying media report increases relative interest in pandemic-related news and the reported incidence of distracting throughts during the task. One plausible interpretation for the combined set of results is that subjects compensate for worry-induced cognitive effects by increasing their mental effort, in line with the notion of income targeting. My findings indicate that exposure to information about the danger of COVID-19 does not have adverse side effects on economic productivity.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors have encouraged a shift to phone surveys for this work, where the research literature on mobile phone surveys in low- and middle-income countries is thin. Much of the literature is also out of date, given the rapid changes in mobile cell phone penetration even among poor households as digital financial tools are used more and more for social protection interventions.

In this study, IPA takes advantage of phone surveys launched in nine countries to embed experiments on the best times and days to initiate phone surveys and the optimal number of attempts for high response rates data quality.

The platform is sending regular newsletters, and has conducted a survey of its own before, so this is not unusual.

Subjects will go through a survey and a choice experiment. The order of these two elements is randomized at subject level. The core of the experiment is to elicit a willingness to accept a donation to one of 3 causes (two environmental, one social) over a 25 Euro voucher, which can be used on the homerocket crowdfunding platform. This choice is incentivized, as we will actually give subjects the voucher or make the donation on their behalf, according to their choice. 

Since the voucher can only be invested in real estate projects, but not in green projects, the choice between the voucher (similar to cash or higher returns) or the green or social causes tells us what subjects truly care about in an incentivized way.

The donations go to one of three organisations: carbonoffset.com, Greenpeace, or the Red Cross Austria. The first two achieve environmental impact, the last achieves social impact. Thus, if subjects give up the voucher to let us make these donation, then this reveals their preference for environmental or social impact.

As we describe in the pre-analysis plan, these elicited willingnesses to pay then help us determine whether investors invest in green projects for their higher expected returns, their environmental impact, or their social impact.",Randomization is determined by qualtrics' random number procedure.,Subject,"We aim for 400 completed surveys/experiments, and will send out email newsletter invitations until we reach this number.

","Abstract: Are investors willing to give up a higher return if the investment generates positive environmental impact? We investigate this question with a decision experiment among crowdfunders, where they choose between a higher return or environmental impact. Overall, 65% of investors choose environmental impact at the expense of a higher return for sufficiently large impact, 14% choose impact independent of the magnitude of impact, while 21% choose the higher return independent of impact. Combining the experimental data with historical investments, we find that investors allocate a larger share of funds to green projects if they value environmental impact more, and if they expect green projects to be more profitable. These findings suggest that investors have a preference for positive environmental impact, and satisfy it by investing in green projects. We further show that the preference for environmental impact is distinct from a preference for positive social impact. Finally, we introduce new survey measures of impact for future use, which are experimentally validated and predict field behavior.

Welfare chauvinists demand priority for natives over immigrants in access to welfare services.
As their arguments go, immigrants lack a contribution history to the welfare state, and they do not share a group identity with natives.
Empirical evidence on welfare chauvinism comes from survey-based studies, entailing limitations in mapping its mechanisms.
To fill this gap, we present the results of a pie--sharing game that enrolled natives of and immigrants to the U.K.. 
We varied which party was attributed with creating the pie and whether partners shared group identity.
Subjects made distributive choices and stated their beliefs about the fair division.
In choices and beliefs, we found evidence for self--serving invocation of contribution history among natives and immigrants, indicating role—-dependent and opportunistic distributive preferences and fairness beliefs.
Natives' and immigrants' choices were uninfluenced by their partner's group identity, but this was not so for fairness beliefs.

Students who do not believe in their ability to succeed may exert little effort, display lower cognitive skills or interact differently with their peers, severely hampering their final achievements. Interventions featuring positive role models have been found effective in raising student's aspirations and, eventually, their academic achievements, and movies conveying hopeful messages are specifically effective on the most disadvantaged students. In this experiment, we test the effect of a short motivational video, where a role model describes their difficult initial condition and their happy ending, on primary and secondary school students' outcomes such as effort, cognitive abilities, prosocial behavior, optimism, and aspirations. Additionally, we test if the gender of the role model matters for the impact, and specifically if the effects are larger for students watching a video with a gender-concordant role model. The experiment is set in one school in Naples, Italy, and involves 400 students of low socio-economic background. All students will be randomized in three treatment arms: students in the first treatment arm will watch a video where a role model of their same gender describe how, starting from a situation of difficulty, s/he managed to succeed in life by finding and pursuing his/her passions. Students in the second treatment arm are shown a similar motivational video featuring a role model of the opposite gender of the respondent.

Since none of these papers revealed the intra-cluster correlations of their sample, we estimated sample size assuming three potential ICCs: 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2.

We aim to tackle the question of whether there are gender differences in how job-seekers perceive their own qualifications for different opportunities, and how this impacts their decision about whether or not to apply. In addition, we ask whether whether reducing ambiguity around required qualifications for a given opportunity reduces the gender gap in willingness to apply among qualified candidates. 

The first experiment we ran for this project was a field experiment on the online labor market platform, UpWork. Serving as a potential employer, we created job opportunities to which participants could apply. In our baseline condition, we found that qualified women were significantly less likely to apply to our more demanding and more lucrative job opportunity than equally qualified men. Our treatment conditions tested a simple policy intervention: we provided more clarity on what “the bar” was in terms of desired qualifications.  We found that the gender gap in in application rates among qualified candidates was reduced when the desired qualifications for the opportunity were less ambiguous.

The study we are pre-registering is a follow-up to that study.

","Abstract: There is evidence that cash transfers reduce intimate partner violence (IPV), but less is known about the impacts of public works and complementary programmes on IPV. Using mixed-methods we examined whether and how the Ethiopian government's public works programme (that includes cash and/or food for work) alongside complementary activities that engage women and men affected IPV. We analysed midline data collected in July–October 2019 from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to measure the added impacts of the complementary programming in the Amhara and Oromia regions. Eligible households for this analysis had at least one child aged 0–35 months and a primary female caregiver who was married, and under 50 years-old (n = 2604). A nested qualitative study was conducted with a sub-sample of RCT participants from February–March 2020; data included seven focus group discussions and 58 in-depth interviews. Male partners of women who reported experiencing IPV were purposively sampled. Ordinary Least Squares regression analyses were used to estimate the average treatment effect of the complementary programming, and sub-analyses were conducted on the poorest ten households from each village who received additional livelihood transfers. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic content analysis. We found no impacts of the complementary programming on IPV in the full sample, but some impacts among the poorest sample. Evidence on pathways found that both the public works and complementary programming decreased poverty-related stress and arguments within relationships and increased emotional wellbeing. There were some impacts on women's empowerment from the complementary programming. However, men's reactions to women's empowerment were mixed. There was strong evidence that engaging men in nutrition behaviour change communication contributed to improving gender relations. Our findings indicate that social protection and complementary programmes have the potential to be gender transformative and prevent the drivers of IPV.

Abstract: Poultry has gained renewed attention as a promising value chain for women because it is an asset that is widely accessible to women, has low start-up costs, and provides a good source of nutritious animal-sourced foods for children in chicken meat and, especially, eggs. The current study presents evidence from an experimental intervention that randomly provided women either a poultry package transfer of vaccinated, improved-breed chickens and related inputs, or a cash grant of equivalent value within a sample of households participating in a social safety net program. These transfers were embedded in a set of intensive livelihood and enhanced nutrition interventions as part of a broader experiment in rural Ethiopia. We assess the impact of the poultry package transfer as well as the enhanced nutrition intervention on the consumption of eggs by both children and adult women. We find that the poultry transfer increased the frequency of egg consumption as well as the sale of eggs, falling between the extreme of an autarkic household and one in which production decisions are fully separable from consumption choices.

Our idea is that an analysis-based approach has a substantial benefit in the development of cognitive skills relative to the common synthesis-based learning process, or broadly speaking deductive learning. The trial is designed as follows: we take two primary school classes with the same teachers, one is used as a control group and the other as a treatment group. The treatment consists of an educational path, designed according to the methodologies of investigation-based science education (IBSE), that it should provide an exogenous variation in the amount of analysis done by the children. Cognitive skills are measured before and after the treatment and compared between the control and the treatment class.
 A first stage of this experiment has been conducted in Rome, Italy, last year. The RCT will continue both in the same classes of the roman primary school in which is conducted the first stage , and in another primary school in Cameroon. The educational path used as treatment are the BUL project in Italy and the TALES project in Cameroon.

",,,12/1/21,1/10/22," Considering the most universally accepted aspects andon which students of the philosophy of logic are in agreement, we can think of Analysis in the educational environment as inquiry-based learning, in which the students build knowledge and abilities from their own by trials and errors.  The learning process is slow but the concepts are deeply understood since they are rebuilt from the interior.  On the other hand, through synthesis students are guided through the concepts.  It may result in a lack of grasp on the learned notions, but the process is fast and it works in various contexts, including large classes. Throughout an analysis-based approach, students are guided along a process that helps the development of the ability to ”build” their knowledge from testing ideas and approaches based on their previous knowledge and experience by applying these new situations and integrating the newly acquired knowledge with preexisting intellectual constructs.  We refer to this ability as Constructive Skill. This concept contrasts with the one of Applied skill, which consists in practical skills, knowledge and tools related to a specific context needed to do some specific task. I present an RCT aimed to assess the causal effect of analysis on the development of Constructive Skill, validating one of the most important theoretical assumptions of the paper.  The trial is structured as follows:  I use an educational path based on the method of analysis, BUL, to produce an exogenous variation in the amount of Analisys which is done. This project is conducted in two classes of a Roman primary school. In the other exercise, the educational path choosen is called TALES and the treatment and the control groups are from a primary school in Cameroon. Then, Constructive skill is measured for every child of the class and for the children of the other class with the same main teacher but that are not undertaking the project, both before and after the period in which the project is undergone. To measure constructive skill, two different proxies are used: an IQ test for children(repeated both before and after the treatment) and a set of logical questions taken from INVALSI tests (different at each measurement, to capture mental elasticity). Concerning the first trial, the one already conducted in Rome, we built  the  IQ  measure following the  MENSA  criteria.    The results gave me a normal shape for the distribution of the IQs, with the average being near 100 (respectively 101, 100 and 104). From the balancing tests the covariates related to nationality of origin, sex and age result to have similar distribution between the control class and the treatment class. The first return test is conducted just two months after the first one and is likely to be strongly influenced by learning effects due to the memory of questions performed only two months earlier.  The test will be repeated during the next year- where the treatment will also continue -, both to quantify the entity of these learning effects and isolate them, and to verify the effects of the treatment after more prolonged exposure. intelligence and nationality have a relevant and significant effect in both exercises.  The impact of the second is not very surprising, as it is evident that children with parents of foreign nationalities face language barriers that slow down not only the learning possibilities but also the effectiveness of an IQ test as these children have to do a greater effort to understand some questions.  Furthermore, this effect becomes greater if the language spoken at home is not Italian.  As regards our variable of interest, we note that the effect on the treatment IQ is not significant.  This is probably due to the persistence of memory effects, as discussed above, combined with the possibility that IQ measures a set of skills related to the g factor, while the Analysis method favors a particular component, the one close to the concept of measured mental elasticity.    For both of these two reasons,  in fact,  the second exercise reveals a significant effect of the treatment.  In order to distinguish the weight and relevance of each of these two topics, the subsequent return tests will be fundamental, which will allow isolating the memory effect. The trial in the primary school in Cameroon will be conducted with the same methodology.",Constructive\Cognitive Skill ,"Throughout an analysis-based approach, students are guided along a process that helps the development of the ability to ”build” their knowledge from testing ideas and approaches based on their previous knowledge and experience by applying these new situations and integrating the newly acquired knowledge with preexisting intellectual constructs.

","Abstract: Bul Game is an online software designed to support didactic activities about logic and its connections with everyday language. The aim of the game is to make correct choices based on statements made by knights, who always tell the truth, and by knaves, who always lie. With small adjustments, the game can be used at all grade levels. As part of a programme to introduce logic at primary school, carried out in two second grade classes of an Italian school with many foreign students and one fourth grade class of a French school in Rome, Bul Game was used at the end of each lesson to consolidate and revise the concepts discussed in class. At the secondary-school level, Bul Game can aid the introduction of connectives and propositional logic, together with the characters of knights and knaves, which are a useful tool for dealing with proofs conducted with game semantics. Bul Game was designed and developed by Giulia Balboni, Luigi Bernardi, Mattia Sanchioni, and Jacopo Zuliani, and it is available for free at www.oiler.education/bul in English, French, and Italian

The EGRS I was an RCT implemented between 2015 and 2017 which tested three interventions: Treatment 1: Training, scripted lessons, graded readers, Treatment 2: Reading Coaches, scripted lessons, graded readers, Treatment 3: Parental involvement Programme. The EGRS I impact evaluation showed that the coaching treatment resulted in statistically significant improvements in African Home Language reading proficiency. A 2019 sustainability assessment of the EGRS I,  indicated that reading proficiency gains were sustained after learners were no longer taught by supported teachers. In response to these encouraging findings, the Reading Support Programme was implemented to test whether a similar intervention can be implemented on a larger scale. The RSP involved all Foundation Phase teachers for two years (The EGRS I targeted one grade’s teachers per annum and provided one year’s support), and delivered the intervention in both Setswana Home Language as well as English First Additional Language (The EGRS I only provided support in Setswana Home Language). Similar to the EGRS, the RSP was designed to test if there were any reading proficiency gains in schools that benefitted from teacher training and scripted lessons, and there was a differential gain in those schools that also benefitted from literacy coaching support and those that benefitted from a leadership development intervention targeted at School Management Team members.  

This 2021 impact evaluation will investigate 1) The impact of EGRS interventions on a cohort of learners tracked for six years from the beginning of Grade 1 (on interventions that ended in either Grade 2 or Grade 3). 2) The impact of RSP interventions (and Classroom Library Program) on a cohort of learners tracked for two years from Grade 1. 3) The impact of RSP interventions (and Classroom Library Program) on learners in Grade 4 in 2021. 4) The impact of both EGRS and RSP on a cohort of learners tracked for two years from Grade 1.

This is a continuation of the Early Grade Reading Study in South Africa, 2016, RCT ID AEARCTR-0001749.
",,,,5/1/15,12/31/20,"DESCRIPTION OF THE EGRS I
This EGRS I was set up as a randomized control trial. The EGRS included three different interventions, all aimed at improving early-grade reading in Setswana. These three interventions were implemented with the teachers of a cohort of learners in Grade 1 in 2015, the teachers of the same cohort of learners in Grade 2 in 2016, and the first two interventions were extended to the teachers of the same learners again in Grade 3 in 2017.
Treatment 1: Training, scripted lessons, graded readers
Treatments 1 and 2 aimed to apply the same set of instructional practices in the teaching of home language literacy in grade 1, 2 and 3 classrooms working in one grade at a time. Both treatments therefore provided teachers with clearly scripted lesson plans, which were aligned to the curriculum as specified in the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS) for home language literacy in the Foundation Phase. The lesson plans incorporated the use of learning support materials including the government-provided workbooks as well as certain additional materials (graded reading booklets, flash cards, posters, etc.), which were provided through the EGRS. The graded reading booklets provided a key resource for the teacher to use in group-guided reading and individual work so as to facilitate reading practice at an appropriate pace and sequence of progression.
Treatment 1 trained the teachers on how to use the lesson plans and accompanying materials through central training sessions, each lasting two days, and occurring twice yearly. 
Treatment 2: Reading Coaches, scripted lessons, graded readers
Exactly the same set of instructional materials (scripted lesson plans, graded reading booklets and other materials) were provided to Treatment 2 schools.  However, instead of central training sessions, one day training/orientation was provided at the start of each term, accompanied by ongoing support to teachers consisting of regular (monthly) on-school coaching from specialist “reading coaches” visits. In addition to these on-site visits, there were occasional needs-based workshops with the coach and a small cluster of nearby Treatment 2 schools. 
Treatment 3: Parental involvement
Treatment 3 was designed to promote parental involvement to support their children’s reading progress. At each of the 50 schools in this treatment arm a Community Reading Coach (CRC) was recruited. The CRC was identified through communication with the school principal who recommended a suitably qualified, but available person in the community. The CRCs attended a one-day training session facilitated by the service provider (Class Act) at the start of each school term (quarterly). The CRCs were trained to deliver weekly training sessions for Grade 1 parents at their respective schools.  A total of 30 sessions were scheduled for each year covering a total of 10 topics.  The parental involvement intervention arm was prematurely ended in 2016, after two years of implementation working first with Grade 1 parents and then Grade 2 parents. The parents of Grade 3 learners were not part of the intervention.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RSP
The RSP was set up as a randomized control trial, with six focus areas.  
1.	Quarterly ‘just in time’ training for teachers (from 263 schools) on the implementations of Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) and lesson plans (all 263 schools)
2.	The provision of Learning and Teaching Support Material (LTSM) packages (all 263 schools).
3.	The provision of 14 literacy coaches to 140 schools to offer classroom-based support to Foundation Phase teachers (Coaching in 140 schools)
4.	The development of the leadership capacity of principals/deputies and Head of Departments (HODs) to promote a culture of reading in their schools (SMT training in 65 schools)
5.	Through the DBE, Classroom libraries are provided to 98 schools
The RSP specifically aims to: improve subject matter knowledge; promote more effective pedagogic practices; improve in-class time management; increase effective use of LTSM; and foster a school environment to support teachers’ ability to implement the full curriculum and facilitate successful teaching and learning.
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN EGRS I AND RSP
In order to set up research questions and analyses accurately, it is helpful to understand how the EGRS and RSP interventions may interact and how they compare, in three areas.
1)	Teacher Training
Teacher training for EGRS I focused on one language (Setswana) and trained one grade of teachers each year, for one year (Grade 1, then Grade 2, then Grade 3). RSP trained all three groups of teachers at the same time for two years in both Setswana and English. We may expect interactions between the two interventions in that some teachers may have received training in Setswana instructions under both programs. 
2)	Coaching
Coaches used in the EGRS program were not reemployed under RSP. Thus, we expect interactions to be limited in the coaching intervention of the two programs. It is possible that teachers who received coaching under EGRS may have been more experienced in getting feedback and may have benefited more from the RSP coaching as a result.
3)	Learner and Teacher Support Materials
These materials were provided under both programs. In EGRS they were only provided for Setswana while the availability of EFAL materials to teachers was not provided and it is not clear what materials were used. In RSP materials were provided for both Setswana and EFAL. These included structured lesson plans, readers and other supporting LTSM. It is possible that the EGRS teachers were better prepared for LTSM use and further leveraged this when receiving RSP materials for both languages. 
 
3.2.	PRIMARY OUTCOMES 
The primary outcome of interest is reading proficiency in Setswana home language (HL) and English first additional language (EFAL). For reading proficiency we will measure all the intermediate steps towards comprehension: letter recognition, phonetic awareness, word recognition and reading, vocabulary, reading fluency, and reading with comprehension. These tests are adapted from standard tests that have already been developed for the English First Additional language and Setswana language, such as the Early-Grade-Reading-Assessment (EGRA), but also newly developed and extensively piloted reading tasks. As our main outcome indicator, we will construct an aggregate indicator of learning proficiency, using principal component analysis.

What is the impact of (i) three years of Coaching + TT + LTSM (ii) three years of TT + LTSM and (iii) two years of Parental Involvement on reading outcomes in Setswana and EFAL, compared to a comparison group receiving no intervention, nearly four years after the completion of all interventions.
RSP
What is the impact of (i) SMT + Coaching + TT + LTSM and (ii) Coaching + TT + LTSM compared to a comparison group receiving TT + LTSM alone on:
•	Reading outcomes in Grade 2 and 3 in Setswana and EFAL?
•	Classroom processes, teacher behavior, school functionality?
Within the main experimental groups, what is the impact of the Classroom Library Program on Reading outcomes in Grades 2 and 3 in Setswana and EFAL?
What is the relationship between fidelity of implementation (i.e. attendance at teacher and SMT training, participation in individual and group coaching) and the improvement in reading in the three groups?
What are the school-level factors mediating the effect of each intervention on learning outcomes? 
How do treatment effects differ between subgroups based on, for example, pupil gender, teacher experience, school location and household profile in parent/guardian education, employment, literacy practices.?
What is the impact of:
i)	 5 years of coaching (EGRS 3 years + RSP 2 years) + 5 years of TT + 5 years of LTSM
ii)	 2 years of RSP coaching + 5 years of TT + 5 years of LTSM
iii)	 2 years of parental involvement + 2 years of RSP coaching +2 years of RSP TT+ 2 years of RSP LTSM
The skills to be assessed include
Grade 3 learners: 
•	Home language: Rapid object naming, letter sound recognition, complex consonants & diacritics recognition, word reading, oral reading fluency and comprehension and listening comprehension. 
•	EFAL: Decodable word reading, sight word reading, oral reading fluency and comprehension.
Grade 4 learners: 
•	Home language: Rapid object naming, letter sound recognition, complex consonants & diacritics recognition, word reading, oral reading fluency and comprehension, written text comprehension. 
•	EFAL: Decodable word reading, oral reading fluency and comprehension, written text comprehension.  
Grade 7 learners: 
•	Home language: Oral reading fluency and comprehension, written text comprehension, vocabulary.
•	EFAL: Oral reading fluency and comprehension, written text comprehension, vocabulary.  
The instruments include tasks that were adapted from standard early grade reading assessments in Setswana and English firs additional language, as well as newly developed and extensively piloted reading tasks. 
As our main outcome indicator, we will construct an aggregate indicator of HL and EFAL learning proficiency, using principal component analysis.
","For the evaluation of RSP we will assess the role of intermediate outcomes in achieving impact in two categories – fidelity of implementation and mediators.
Fidelity of Implementation
The fidelity of implementation analysis will aim to understand whether schools implementing the interventions to a higher standard achieved greater improvements in reading outcomes. To do this, we will identify candidate variables from the contextual tools during the data collection pilot, in addition to data already collected from the RSP implementation to indicate fidelity of implementation (e.g., teacher use of national workbook) and assess the relationship between each of these variables and reading outcomes. It is not possible to identify a causal relationship between fidelity of implementation and reading outcomes because of confounding factors. To control for observed confounding factors, we will include baseline characteristics of schools as covariates in these analyses. 
Data available from the RSP implementation evaluation include: number of teachers per school attending training and receiving coaching and whether schools received project materials.
Mediators
The mediator analysis aims to identify the mechanism for the impact of interventions on outcomes. Mediators are typically school level processes (e.g., teacher corrects learner work) that are enhanced by the intervention and which lead to improved reading outcomes. Mediator variables that meet some or all of the following criterial will be considered. 
(1)	The intervention has a significant impact on the mediator
(2)	There is a significant relationship between the mediator and reading outcomes
(3)	The impact of the treatment variables on HL and EFAL reading proficiency is attenuated when the mediator is included in the regression equation.
Below are potential mediating variables (these will be determined during the final data analysis).
Teachers
Did the EGRS I and RSP treatment arms which involves training and coaching change teaching practice and effort?
1.	Provide regular individualized assessment 		[TRQ – 3.7 and 3.10, CLW Section 2

2.	Require student to read out loud			[TRQ – 3.7 and 3.10)]

8.	Increase the availability of home language text in classrooms [CLW Section 3]

Did EGRS I treatment arm lead to a change in parent attitudes and behavior?
1.	Happy with child’s reading progress 				[PHQ -- 27]
2.	Read to child							[PHQ – 19]
3.	Support child doing homework				[PHQ – 30 and 31]
Pupils
1.	Pupil attendance						[PRQ – 25]
2.	Pupil do homework on days not at school			[PHQ – 29]
Heterogeneous Impacts
At the pupil level, we could expect two opposing heterogeneous treatment effects of the EGRS and RSP interventions, based on baseline pupil reading proficiency. The scripted lesson plans require streaming by ability within the same classroom and provides opportunity for individualized attention and could benefit children who have otherwise been left behind. However, at the same time the scripted lesson plans are aligned to the national curriculum, which prescribes an ambitious pace in the South African context. The worst-performing pupils might benefit less if the teachers who follow the scripted lesson plans now progress at too fast a pace. Furthermore, boys/girls might benefit more/less from the individualized attention. Finally, the emphasis on individualized attention and tracking means that pupils might benefit more from the scripted lesson plans when the class size is large. 
For the RSP evaluation, we expect that the success of the interventions depend on teacher motivation, prior levels of effort, and ability. The scripted lesson plans will only be applied by teachers who have a sufficient level of intrinsic motivation. Related, teachers who have a higher burden of lesson preparation are most likely to switch to scripted lesson plans, because they have most to gain from scripted lesson. Furthermore, teachers may need a sufficient baseline level of reading proficiency in order to effectively apply the scripted lesson plans. On the other hand, the scripted lesson plans might be too restrictive for exceptional teachers who are effective at adjusting their instruction to the needs of the classroom and ability of the pupils.
We will therefore examine the following possible interactions:

",,"EVALUATION DESIGN EGRS I
The EGRS I was designed as a randomized control trial (RCT) with three treatment arms and one control arm. A total of 230 schools were randomly assigned to one of the intervention groups (50 schools each), or the control group (80 schools).  To evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions, a random sample of 20 learners were selected in Grade 1 in 2015 and were tracked into Grade 2.  Learners’ reading proficiency was tested at the start of Grade 1, at the end of Grade 1, and again at the end of Grade 2. 
Treatment Assignment and Random Selection for EGRS I impact evaluation
The sampling process for the EGRS I began with 458 primary schools registered in 2014 administrative data in the districts of Dr. Kenneth Kaunda and Ngaka Modiri Molema. The sampling started by excluding relatively affluent schools (those in quintiles 4 and 5). Next, schools were excluded in which the language of instruction in the Foundation Phase was not Setswana. Schools were also excluded if they were missing in the 2014 Annual National Assessment (ANA)  dataset. An additional eight schools were excluded because they took part in the EGRS pilot. Small schools (fewer than 20 Grade 1 enrolments) were also excluded because many of them practice multi-grade teaching rendering the scripted lesson plans less appropriate. Larger schools (more than 180 Grade 1 enrolments) were also excluded to limit intervention costs. Three more schools were excluded after the North West PED checked the list of schools and found specific problems with these schools (e.g., the school had been closed down, or a particular conflict around school management was occurring in a school). After all of these exclusions 235 eligible schools remained.  Using a random number generator, five schools were selected as possible replacement schools, with the remaining 230 schools constituting the main sample.
To increase power and assure balance between treatment arms, stratified randomization was performed. Ten strata of 23 similar schools each were created, based on school size, socio-economic status, and previous performance in the Annual National Assessments. Within each stratum, five schools were randomly assigned to each treatment group and eight to the control group. In total, 50 schools were assigned to each treatment group and 80 to the control group. Sample size calculations indicated that this sample is sufficient to identify a minimum effect size of 0.21 standard deviations when comparing a treatment group with the control group and a minimum effect size of 0.23 standard deviations when comparing two treatment groups. These calculations are based on data collection from 20 Grade 1 learners and assume a 95% confidence interval, an alpha value of 0.8, an intra-class correlation coefficient (rho) of 0.3 and a correlation between pre- and post-test scores of 0.7. 
EVALUATION DESIGN RSP
A sample of 214 schools that were part of the EGRS and part of the RSP 2018 baseline data collection is included in the impact evaluation. This includes all intervention groups. Lastly, 15 schools that were part of the original EGRS sample were not included in the RSP baseline because they had converted to multi-grade schools. 
Schools were assigned to RSP treatment groups as follows. The 50 schools that were in the parent group under EGRS were assigned to be the comparison group for RSP, because the parent intervention had no impact. The comparison group received training and LTSM only. In addition, 80 schools that were not part of EGRS received the same (comparison) interventions under RSP. This group is not part of the RSP evaluation design, as they were not included in the baseline evaluation and have not received an intervention to be evaluated. Schools in the three remaining EGRS groups - Training (50 schools), Coaching (50 schools) and Control (80 schools) - received training and coaching under RSP. In addition, half of the schools in each group were allocated randomly to receive a School Management Training (SMT), in addition to coaching. Without schools dropping out, this procedure should have resulted in 90 schools receiving coaching alone, 90 schools receiving coaching and SMT and 50 schools receiving only training and LTSM, received by all other groups. However, approximately 60 schools dropped out of the study, according to the most recent (January 2021) DBE database. Table 2 shows the number of schools remaining in the RSP and EGRS groups.

Sample size calculations are conducted to inform design decisions. Below we calculate the number of learners required to achieve a reasonable minimum detectable effect size (MDES) of approximately 0.21 SDs (the MDES for the originally-designed EGRS comparison between treatment and control). For the RSP Grade 3 and EGRS Wave 6 evaluations, the sample size is determined by the number of learners who were assessed at baseline and who are present on the day of assessment. We based the calculations below on the sample sizes estimated in and using a longitudinal design (i.e., controlling for baseline values). The RSP Grade 2 evaluation uses a cross-sectional design (i.e., there is no baseline) and therefore relies only on a comparison across groups being made at a single time point. 
We have also conducted sample size calculations (and associated MDES) for two evaluation approaches for both EGRS and RSP. In both cases, we estimate the MDES for the original, longitudinal design and also include an estimate of the MDES for a cross-sectional design that includes a ‘top-up’ of students. It is clear from the results in Table 5 that the marginal benefit of the cross-sectional top-up is minimal and we therefore recommend using the longitudinal design. Our recommended samples sizes are therefore ~12 students in EGRS Grade 6; ~16 students in Grade 2 and ~16 students in Grade 3 for RSP. Additional assumptions and explanations are provided in the section below Table 5.

μ_1 is the control’s mean of the Grade 2 learners’ scores.
μ_2 is the treatment’s mean of the Grade 2 learners’ scores.

RSP Impact Grade 1 (2018) – Grade 3 (Grade 4 or lower in 2021) 
Given the current sample size of schools and assuming an attrition rate of 17 percent, we would expect an average of 16 learners who were assessed in Grade 1 in 2018 to be assessed in 2021.  Given the following assumptions below, we expect the minimal detectable effect size approximately 0.18 with a longitudinal analysis. This translates to an approximate gain of five correct words per minute in the measure of reading fluency of the intervention groups over the comparison group.

EGRS 1 Impact Grade 1 (2015) – Grade 4 (2018) – Grade 6 (Grade 7 or lower in 2021) 
The current sample size of schools and assuming an attrition rate of 40 percent, we would expect on average 12 learners (who were assessed in Grade 1 in 2015) per school will be assessed in 2021.  Given the following assumptions below, we expect the minimal detectable effect size would be approximately 0.18 for this longitudinal analysis.

Description:  The Early Grade Reading Study (EGRS I) evaluated three Setswana Home Language interventions: teacher training, on-site training and coaching, and parental involvement. To evaluate the impact and sustainability of the EGRS, data was collected in 2021 by Khulisa. The purpose was to determine whether the results from the original cohort of learners whose teachers received the intervention, would be sustained into Grade 7 in
2021. 
The results show evidence of a sustained impact from the coaching intervention on several 
Setswana (home language) outcomes. Although there was a significant average impact for 
all learners in the coaching intervention on only one of the Setswana oral reading passages, 
the most consistent impacts were for learners who received the maximum dosage of the 
EGRS I intervention in Grades 1 to 3 (i.e., those who progressed, as intended, through the 
three years of the intervention from 2015 to 2018). Significant impacts were found for these 
learners on four of the seven Setswana reading outcomes (with marginally significant 
impacts on the rest). This provides evidence that results from an early grade reading 
intervention can be sustained into upper grades but also points to the importance of dosage. 
Interestingly, the coaching intervention also showed a statistically significant impact on 
retention, with a smaller proportion of attriting learners than the control group (38% versus 
45%).
While English First Additional Language (EFAL) results followed a similar pattern to Setswana HL results (with the largest magnitude, positive impacts for the coaching intervention), there were ultimately no statistically significant long-term intervention crossover effects on EFAL. Additionally, heterogeneous impacts were limited, with some evidence that learners with different baseline scores (from Grade 1) may have been impacted differently by the interventions.

At the same time, little effort has been made towards increasing physician-side price transparency, which may be due to limited high-quality research being available on the topic. I try to address this limitation in the literature by performing a field experiment on physician price transparency for an area that has received little attention: physician referrals. Working with a group of medical practices linked as an Independent Practice Association (IPA), I randomly selected primary care practices to receive a list of prices for new referrals to six ophthalmology practices that were part of the IPA's provider network. These practices handled the bulk of the IPA's ophthalmology patients and represented substitute providers. Using the IPA's administrative data on referrals, I find that during the first two months following the distribution of the price list, the treatment group primary care physicians (PCPs) increased referral share towards the least expensive ophthalmology practice by 147 percent. These referrals were allocated away from the most expensive practice and those not listed on the report. These effects were only found, however, for patients for whom the PCPs had a cost reduction incentive. The large initial effect dissipated over the following four months. For patients with a limited financial interest for the PCPs, I find little evidence of a treatment response. These contrasting results suggest the PCPs were influenced by cost reduction motives and provide evidence of the potential for savings from physician-side price transparency.",,,,5/5/14,11/15/14,"The experimental treatment for this study was a report listing two numbers for each of six busy ophthalmology practices. The numbers were risk-adjusted, 180-day cost averages for newly referred patients to ophthalmology for both HMO and Medicare Advantage patients. Together with the cost report, the treatment group PCPs also received a cover letter from the CEO of the IPA, briefly explaining the reason for receiving the report and a description of how the costs were calculated.

The cost report was comprised of two parts: the cost table and a set of footnotes with additional information. On the left side of the table were the names of six ophthalmology practices. Below each practice name were the names of the IPA network ophthalmologists associated with each of those practices in smaller, italicized print. On the right were two costs, one for each type of patient, for each practice.","My primary outcome is the share of a PCP practice's ophthalmology referrals that an ophthalmology practice receives, measured on a bimonthly basis (two-month periods).",,,,"The subjects of the experiment were all PCPs associated with the IPA who practiced in either the family practice or internal medicine specialties in an outpatient (ambulatory) setting. Subjects assigned to the treatment group all received an informational treatment: a letter containing historical average costs of six ophthalmology practices affiliated with the IPA, the ``treatment,'' ``prices,'' or ``cost report.'' Control group subjects did not receive anything. In order to maximize the experiment sample size, all of the IPA's PCPs who were active at the time of the treatment distribution were included if they satisfied minimal criteria: they must have had at least ten claims during each calendar month from August 2013 through January 2014, and made at least one patient referral to ophthalmology during that period. In the end, a total of 93 PCPs -- 35 internists and 58 family practitioners -- were included in the experiment. These physicians were typically organized into group practices. In total, there were 55 included practices, with 24 of them being internal medicine, 30 family practice, and one mixed specialty group. 

To account for the organization of PCPs into practices, assignment into treatment and control groups took place at the practice level, so that either all PCPs in a practice were assigned to the treatment group, or none were.

During the experiment, the IPA collected data on PCP referrals as part of its normal operations. This data was generated by the PCPs' activities of seeing and treating patients as part of their usual medical practices in their regular offices. The IPA regularly collects all of this data, and all of the physicians are aware of this data collection. Moreover, none of the physicians were made aware that the distribution of the price information was related to an experiment, thereby minimizing any possible influence of the ``Hawthorne effect.''",,Randomization by computer.,"Medical primary care practice.

We uniformly draw participants from this restricted set. The total number of participants that will be drawn initially is 1,500. 40 of those have been treated in a pilot that was conducted in Oct/Nov 2021 to check the operational implementability (10 in G1, 10 in G2, 20 in G3; half of each group with framing F2). 960 will be treated in the main round of the experiment (40% of them in G1, 30% in G2, 30% in G3; each group equally split between F1 and F2). 

The remaining list of 500 may be used in an additional round: 19 weeks after the main round, any money that is being returned to the researchers (from G3 because of the weekly “interest payments”, or unspent balances from G2) will be distributed to another group “G1+” that has the same treatment as G1 (and do not receive a framing treatment). The sample size in this treatment will be chosen to use up the returned money.

In this experiment, we vary if the prompt to undergo an assessment comes from a human mediator or from the system. A priori it is not clear if making the involvement of algorithm salient would increase or decrease the take up of the assessment in the context of mental health. Given the shortage of psychologists and high demand for mental health support, technologies such as mental health mobile apps are a powerful force in delivering mental health support to those in need.

The treatments differ subtly in wording used to offer the prompt to undergo the assessment. The treatment either displays the involvement of a human or an algorithm in offering the prompt. As a main outcome variable we consider if the user took the assessment. Taking the assessment was a desirable action that would increase the quality of the match but it did not exclude users from communicating with a mediator and ultimately receiving the match with the therapist.,"The primary outcome of interest is (1) a user’s decision to undergo the assessment after the prompt. Additionally, we will consider (2) the attrition rates measured as a difference between the number of people who started the assessment and those who completed it, (3) time needed to complete the assessment, (4) if users open the report after completing the assessment.
Due to the field setting of the experiment, we do not have comprehensive data on each user’s demographic or other potentially relevant characteristics and have only limited ability to elaborate on mechanisms. The user data is anonymized.
As users were randomized at the registration, main outcomes will be analysed using t-tests. In addition, the compliance decision and attrition will be analysed using probit regressions controlling for a proxy of a geographical location as supplied by the data provider, age and gender as estimated from the chat data in the app. Additionally, we will use machine learning techniques to analyze the chat data (where available and feasible).

Knowledge about meat
Attitudes towards meat","- Willingness to pay for information about meat (WTP) is asked for each combination of meat type (beef / pork) with topic (animal welfare / environment / health). Its elicitation is incentivized. It can reflect both information-seeking and information-avoidance.

- Knowledge about meat is measured by a battery of multiple choice questions about meat production/consumption. Correct answers are rewarded. Answering ""I don't know"" is an option. Some of the questions concern negative consequences of meat consumption. 

- Attitudes towards meat are measured by a battery of statements to which participants can agree more or less on a seven-point scale. A subset of these statements justifies meat consumption and hence forms the meat justification score. Another subset of these statements concerns the negative consequences of meat consumption. 

[The exact questions can be found in the supplementary documents named ""Survey_Questions.pdf"", ""Knowledge_Questions.pdf"" and ""WTP_Questions.pdf"".]",,,"The study consists of a sequence of online survey and lab experiment.

Subjects are randomly assigned to two treatments and a control, constituting the exogenous variation in this study.","We use two treatments and a control, to assess if the consumption of meat in the lab influences attitudes, knowledge and willingness to pay for information (WTP) about meat. Subjects are randomly assigned to the two treatments T-Past and T-Future and to the baseline treatment T-Control. Subjects in T-Past are served meat before their WTP, attitudes and knowledge are elicited. Subjects in T-Future anticipate that they will be served meat after their WTP, attitudes and knowledge are elicited. Subjects in T-Control only differ in that they are not served any meat before or after their WTP, attitudes and knowledge are elicited. 

Consuming meat may create cognitive dissonance when confronted with its consequences for animal welfare, the environment, and own health. Based on the literature on motivated beliefs (Bénabou and Tirole, 2016) and information avoidance (Golman et al., 2017), we conjecture that eating meat fosters the tendency to avoid and disregard information concerning meat, in particular concerning the negative consequences of meat consumption.

Quality upgrading in the street food market: are better infrastructure and training sufficient?,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/8797,9/27/24,9/27/24 4:59,4/18/22,AEARCTR-0008797,10.1257/rct.8797-2.0,Denni Tommasi denni.tommasi@unibo.it,completed,4/18/22,2/17/23,"[""behavior"", ""health"", ""labor"", ""Informal sector"", ""street food vending"", ""micro-entrepreneurs"", ""sanitation""]",India (West Bengal),Caitlin Brown (caitlin.brown@manchester.ac.uk) University of Manchester ,"I15, O12, O17, Q18",,"Street vending, the activity of selling goods and services in the streets without having a permanent built-up structure, is a large and growing sector across the developing world: vendors make up between 2 and 24 per cent of total urban informal employment in African, Asian and Latin American cities (Wongtada, 2014; ILO, 2018). Among street vendors, food sellers represent the most visible group as they provide affordable and nutritional food to 2.5 billion consumers every day, especially to those of low- and middle- incomes (FAO, 2007). However, street-food vendors are also considered a threat for public health, as street food is one of the main determinants of foodborne diseases. 

Currently, India is the leading country among emerging economies attempting to structurally transform this sector. The 2014 “National Act for Urban Street Vendors” aims to formalize the unorganized street vending sector through a number of regulatory measures, including also recommendations concerning health and hygienic standards for vendors selling food (NPUSV, 2009).  However, implementation of this policy has been hampered by a variety of factors, such as the lack of compliance and enforcement of regulations and poor targeting of scarce public resources (Daniele, Mookerjee, and Tommasi, 2021). Progress is further complicated by the absence of microeconomic details about the activities conducted by the main actors in this market: street vendors and consumers.

In this project, we take a microeconomic approach and focus specifically on the public health aspects of the ongoing transformation of the street vending sector. In particular, we aim to understand in detail the factors that can influence the production and consumption of safer food in urban street food markets in Kolkata, India. We use this context as our “laboratory” to gain new insights that can be transferred to other cities, states and countries experiencing similar issues in this yet formalized sector.

In collaboration with international and national organizations, we plan to provide (subsidizing) for free health-related infrastructure to a random sample of street-food vendors that are too costly for them to buy and that are not provided by the local authorities. This is an in-kind transfer worth $400 per vendor (roughly, 3-month net income in our context). A second treatment arm will provide additional training on safe food preparation practices, in addition to the infrastructure. The experiment is to test whether this investment is sufficient to sustain a “better equilibrium” in terms of adoption and practices that we can observe and measure concerning the production of safer food. 

In addition, we also plan to conduct a comprehensive series of discrete choice experiments on consumers to elicit their preferences and experiences with safe street food. Combining these data, we aim to answer the following set of questions: 1) How safe is street food and its inputs in this market and how stable are these statistics? 2) What is the correlation between food safety, production inputs, safe food handling practices and behaviours? 3) Are prices a signal of higher food safety in different markets? 4) Are poorer consumers more at risk from unsafe street food? 5) What are consumer preferences for safe street food? 6) How do they react to changes in prices and quality of the street food? 

Despite the size and importance of the street vending sector, there is relatively little research on the relationship between food safety and its microeconomic determinants, such as production inputs and prices. Our project will fill this gap while providing a complementary analysis to any macroeconomic investigation of the issue. We attempt to bridge two important strands of research which occur in economics and microbiology: namely, work on food safety practices among informal vendors in developing countries and the health impacts of unsafe food.
 
We build upon the seminal work by Daniele et al (2021), which is the most comprehensive (microeconomic) study on the public health issues surrounding the informal street vending sector. We also expand on the existing microbiological literature that has documented harmful pathogens in street food in developing countries (Abrahale et al. (2019) provides a review) and the work that has documented the extent of unsafe food safety practices among street food vendors (Muinde and Kuria (2005); Chukuezi (2010); Muyanja et al. (2011); Samapundo et al. (2015); among many others).",,,,6/6/22,8/19/22,"We are providing (subsidizing) for free a set of infrastructure to vendors that are too costly for them to buy and that are not provided by the local authorities either.

In addition, we also plan to conduct a comprehensive series of discrete choice experiments on consumers to elicit their preferences and experiences with safe street food. The experiment is to test whether this subsidized investment is sufficient to sustain a “better equilibrium” in terms of adoption and practices (that we can observe and measure) concerning the production of safer food. The simple hypothesis underlying our intervention is that this subsidized investment could enable vendors to offer consumers a wider array of desirable and profitable products and services by removing the cost barrier. We intend to verify that this is appropriate in our context by investigating both that vendors have high perceived costs of providing hygienic services at baseline and that consumers have a positive willingness to pay for food that is perceived as more hygienic.","Behavior of the street food vendors in terms of adopting safe and hygienic food handling methods. We are interested in whether or not they use the infrastructure provided; if so, what are the impacts on their business outcomes, if not, why and what can be done to improve the safety of street food given this.

",,"Our design is a stratified (blocked) random assignment with 2 levels. Hence, the sample is divided in clusters of street vendors which are then randomly assigned to different treatment groups, namely: treatment C, T1 and T2. Since the assignment is at the cluster level, all vendors in a particular cluster are assigned to the identical treatment group. The assignment of the treatments, coupled with regular monitoring of their food handling practices throughout the intervention, allows us to observe and identify changes in their behavior. The different treatment groups have different incentive schemes to reward the vendors for improving their practices, allowing us to identify the relative importance of factors that might be prompting their decisions. Finally, a measure of the spatial distance between different clusters allows us to estimate the spillover effects or externalities arising from the treatments.","*** Main characteristics of our design

●	Areas: 
o	There are 3 areas: 1) Sector V, 2) Dalhousie and 3) Hazra.
o	Sector V is the IT hub of Kolkata, where consumers have higher income and vendors adopt safer practices. 
o	Both Dalhousie and Hazra are quite large and diverse areas in KMC. 
o	Dalhousie is the central business district of Kolkata. It means that, practically, Dalhousie is the only office area, so major consumers are employees. This area has a greater number of vendors and a variety of foods available. There are only food vendors here.
o	Hazra (+ Rashbihari) has offices, hospitals, religious temple (India famous Kali temple – every year hundreds of pilgrims from different parts of India visit the temple), markets, cinema hall and residential area. So, the consumer types are employees, tourists, pilgrims, shoppers, residential people, people visiting hospital etc. and that also implies the consumer’s financial capacity has a huge difference. This area has a smaller number of vendors than Dalhousie and also less variety of food. Also, there are not only food vendors; there are many types of vendors like garments, shoes, jewellery, etc.

●	Clusters: 
o	In each area, we divide vendors in natural urban clusters of 1, 2 to 3, 4 to 8 vendors each.
o	A cluster is defined in the following way:
▪	If a vendor does not have anyone nearby in a ray of 30 meters forms a cluster on his own. This is because he is a “monopolist” of food in his surroundings.
▪	If a vendor has 1 or 2 neighbours nearby in a ray of 30 meters forms a cluster of 2 or 3 vendors. They are “oligopolists” of food in their surroundings.
▪	In streets where there are many vendors one after the other, we take the distance from the leftmost vendor to the rightmost vendor and consider a cluster the collection of those vendors that are at most 30 meters apart from each other. This means that in some cases we have clusters of 4 vendors or 5 vendors. In rare cases, we have clusters of 6 vendors (1 case) or 8 vendors (3 cases).
▪	In our sample, there are 88 clusters in total. 31 in Sector V, 29 in Dalhousie, and 28 in Hazra.

●	Vendors are allocated to 3 treatment groups:
o	C: receive a personal banner and menu card.
o	T1: receive the same as C, plus the infrastructure.
o	T2: receive the same as T1, plus capacity building.

●	Group sizes:
o	C: 100 vendors, distributed in roughly 35 clusters.
o	T1: 90 vendors, distributed in roughly 35 clusters.
o	T2: 90 vendors, distributed in roughly 35 clusters.

Hence, our sample is made of 280 vendors, in roughly 90 clusters, distributed in 3 areas (Sector V, Dalhousie, Hazra).

The command provides power calculations for a setting like ours if you already have pilot data that you can use. We do have data from 2015-2016 on 4 indexes: 1) p_ind_facilities, 2) p_ind_handling, 3) p_ind_costumer  and 4) p_ind_total. These data are for 1 wave before treatment and 5 waves after treatment. Since in this current experiment we have 12 waves after treatment, we can only do a power analysis assuming half of the sample size. This power analysis will be our upper bound.

To calculate a lower bound, we use the familiar -sampsi- command. This command does not require previous data, hence it can be used to perform power calculations assuming any number of repeated measures of the observations. The problem with -sampsi- is that it does not allow for cluster randomization. Hence, power calculation with -sampsi- will constitute a lower bound because, even though we can assume we have 12 waves, we need to assume that ICC = 0. 

More specifically, we need to make 3 simplifications:

1)	Treatment is administered at level 1.
●	In our experiment, the treatment is administered at level 2 for simplification and logistical reasons.
●	However, vendors run their business individually, and the treatments are delivered at the individual level. Hence, given the context and the specific implementation, this is not a strong simplification.
●	In practice this means that ICC is very small.
2)	Stratification does not help explaining the outcome variables.
•	We use two variables on which we stratify on.
•	Based on the data from 2015, the variable “area” explains only 5% of the variation.
•	We don’t have data that helps understand how much cluster size explains.
•	So, in practice, this is a conservative simplifying assumption. 
3)	Spillover effects are negligible. 
•	We don’t know whether ex ante spillover effects are negligible. 
•	Based on the data from 2015, it is unlikely to observe spillover effects. Also because vendors are credit constrained.
•	In practice this means that, if there is an effect, this effect is only “direct”. The indirect effect = 0.
•	However, given how vendors are distributed on the street, and given the fact that we know exactly each vendor’s GPS location, we will be able to measure spillover effects. So, we will be able to relax this assumption.

In our context, we have 90 vendors per treatment group. We observe each vendor 1 time before treatment, and 12 times after treatment. To calculate key parameters, I use the data from 2015. 

I type the following codes: 

use 1.data_vendors.dta,clear
keep if food_meal==1 | food_heavy==1
tsset id period

Then, for each index of behaviour, I calculate the correlation between follow-up measurements:

reg p_ind_total L.p_ind_total i.area
reg p_ind_costumer L.p_ind_costumer i.area
reg p_ind_handling L.p_ind_handling i.area
reg p_ind_facilities L.p_ind_facilities i.area

Each of the following calculations guarantee a power > 0.80

Hence, under the above simplifications, and using ANCOVA method, we should be able to estimate a MDES > 0.21.","Name: University of Bologna

","Abstract: We propose an easy-to-use method for estimating preference parameters experimentally: choices from strictly concave budget restrictions (SCBRs). SCBRs generalize the popular method of analyzing choices from linear budget restrictions (LBRs). SCBRs promise (i) to improve the informational content of individual choices by reducing the number of corner allocations and (ii) to increase the range of identifiable behavioral types. Two online studies on risk and time preferences confirm the benefits of SCBRs vis-à-vis LBRs: (i) They reduce corner allocations drastically and make more participants estimable individually. (ii) They elicit a richer distribution of preference parameters, specifically, distinguishing linear from convex utility.

The CBOs are given a direct financial stake in the performance of their local government, by promising them an unconditional cash grant that is proportional to improvements in their municipal government's performance indicators over a two-year period, as measured independently through Burkina Faso's annual municipal performance monitoring survey (SUPERMUN). 

Under the 3PPP scheme, the partner CBOs can potentially increase their payoff by nudging their local government to improve its performance. However, since the cash grants are not conditional on any specific actions the CBOs undertake -- even if the CBO does nothing at all, it remains eligible to receive the cash grant -- it incentivizes only those actions the CBO believes to be worth their time and promising enough to have an actual impact on municipal government performance.

This study will assess the impact of Sunaula Hazar Din (SHD), a program implemented by the Government of Nepal. SHD uses the Rapid Results Approach (RRA) to improve nutritional indicators of pregnant women and children 0 to 24 months old, as well as family planning of women aged 15-25 years old. The evaluation will measure its effect on nutritional attitudes and outcomes. RRA is a results-focused learning process aimed at jump-starting major change efforts and enhancing implementation capacity. The approach creates motivation and confidence by defining goals and monitoring results in short periods (usually 100 days) and mobilizing communities to act and coordinate.

What does the study involve?
SHD will be implemented in randomly selected Village Development Committees. Community members can voluntarily participate in the activities organized by SHD in their Village Development Committee. Interviews and anthropometric measurements (such as height and weight) of children will be carried out at the start of the study and 24 months later to find out the impact of SHD on family planning and nutritional indicators.

Experiments in cognitive and experimental psychology have made good use of the idea that associative learning events might trigger conditioning-induced hallucinations. Hallucinations may have an impact on memory. Semantic memory can be changed by hallucinations. Although almost all of human behavior is based on semantic memory, which encompasses all learned information about the outside world, its neurological underpinnings are still unclear. These convergences allow for new representations of perceptual experience that are increasingly abstract and support a range of conceptual activities such as language, social cognition, object recognition, and the amazing ability of humans to remember the past and imagine the future. We first conducted a trial without audio conditioning to ascertain users' cognitive functioning when exposed to generated hallucinations. The results showed that a person's memory may be impacted by particular situations. Subsequently, we designed an interactive scenario with the goal of eliciting mild to moderate negative auditory-visual hallucinations conditioned with positive audio and positive to moderate positive visual hallucinations conditioned with negative audio, followed by a combination of the two. In both visually produced and visually induced hallucinations conditioned by the audio, participants acted out the scenario. Higher degrees of absorption were observed by those who rehearsed the hallucinations conditioned with audio, and this in turn increased the intensity of their cognitive response to the event. Using an advanced program called Psychopy, the individuals' cognitive states were evaluated through the use of a Semantic Memory Scale and PANSS to measure both positive and negative symptoms. Following their exposure to conditionally triggered hallucinations, there was a notable impact on the subjects' semantic memory.",,,,7/1/23,1/15/24,To explore effect of conditioning evoked hallucinations on memory of healthy individuals,"The significance of this experimental study is embedded in its research design. We are using a completely different approach to assess cognitive change. The cross-sectional designs, while potentially well-suited for large samples, are often underpowered, overgeneralized, and ill-approximated to the statistical assumptions implied by general linear methods. For these reasons, we are experimenting with time-series techniques to explicitly investigate the time-dependent variation that can be observed within individual subjects. We are going to assess cognitive changes of induced hallucinations both visual and auditory with different pairings between them over a very short period of time.

Based on these power calculations, we selected 120 of the 185 eligible livelihoods groups, removing groups from the sampling frame that were very small (fewer than 10 eligible participants) or very large (more than 30 eligible participants) to reduce the likelihood of differently-sized treatment and control groups and to facilitate survey and program logistics. We then removed ineligible members from this list, including members who were over 75 years old, members who were also in our CSW sample, members who were part of the bicycle supervisory committee (BSC), members who were listed under multiple names, and households that were listed in multiple livelihoods groups. We sampled up to 12 members per livelihoods group from the remaining list to participate in the baseline survey. If a livelihoods group had fewer than 12 eligible members, we sampled them all. We designated any remaining members as replacements and randomized the order in which they should be used to replace sampled respondents. We included the full list of 324 CSWs in our baseline sample.
During baseline data collection, we identified additional ineligible participants, including households relocated from the study area and households with BSCs not identified in the original sampling frame. Our final survey sample includes 1,297 Livelihoods group members (LGM) from 120 livelihoods groups and 273 CSWs, or 1,570 total respondents. After baseline data collection, we randomized survey respondents into treatment and control arms. We randomized 120 livelihoods groups into 60 treatment livelihoods groups (comprising 640 members surveyed at baseline) and 60 control livelihoods groups (comprising 657 members surveyed at baseline), stratifying on livelihoods group type (savings, women/gender, cooperative & multipurpose, and youth groups) and average reported distance that members had to travel to the group.

","Abstract: Asbestos in Australian homes is getting older and degrading, increasing the risk that harmful fibres are released.

In partnership with the Asbestos and Silica Safety and Eradication Agency (ASSEA), BETA surveyed over 4,400 owners of homes built before 1990, to determine which financial incentives would encourage them to proactively remove asbestos from their properties.

Of the incentives we tested in a discrete choice experiment, homeowners strongly preferred grants – but grants can have economic downsides, like cost inflation. Loans and tax offsets appeared to be marginally effective. Homeowners are likely to respond to programs that clearly communicate their concrete financial benefits.

Our survey revealed that although costs vary widely and can be prohibitive, most homeowners could afford many asbestos removal jobs. Clearly communicating the likely price, process and benefits may clarify that asbestos removal is achievable.

Many homeowners do not know if their property contains asbestos or not. Furthermore, many are not motivated to find out. Incentives that encourage discovery may lead to an increase in asbestos removal rates.

While many homeowners indicated that health concerns would increase their willingness to remove asbestos, our survey also revealed that in practice most homeowners remove asbestos only when renovating. Asbestos removal incentives could be packaged with support for other types of home upgrades (like energy efficiency or disaster preparedness).
