1,The Effect of Atheism Primes on Self-reported and and Implicit Religiosity,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/766,7/8/15,7/8/15 5:12,7/8/15,AEARCTR-0000766,10.1257/rct.766-3.0,Johannes Haushofer haushofer@gmail.com,completed,4/25/15,6/15/15,"[""welfare"", ""Religion""]",Kenya (Nairobi),James Reisinger (jr27@princeton.edu) Princeton University,,,"In recent years, atheism has grown in popularity, partly inspired by the rise to prominence of a group of public intellectuals called the ‚ÄúNew Atheists‚Äù who argue against religion in public fora. Does exposure to the concept of atheism affect religiosity? We test in a laboratory study in Kenya whether exposure to arguments of the style made by the ‚ÄúNew Atheists‚Äù impact selfreported and implicit religiosity measures. The present documents outlines the analyses to be conducted to answer this question.",,,,4/25/15,6/15/15,"Manipulations
The primes used for the study consist of short video presentations (in English) and a writing task in which subjects are asked to summarize the main point of the primes. There are three conditions: emotional anti-religious argument, rational anti-religious argument, and control. Each prime is approximately 4 minutes long and consists of a speaker making various points about religion, or in the case of the control, about vegetables. The speaker is the same Kenyan narrator in all three videos. Bullet points summarizing the main arguments appear on the screen, accompanying the auditory presentation by the speaker. In the emotional condition, the speaker argues that any God must be very cruel if he allows so many people in the world to suffer, concluding that it is unlikely that God exists. In the rational condition, the speaker argues that the existence of God is unnecessary to explain the universe given our scientific knowledge. In the control condition, the same speaker instead argues that it is important to eat vegetables every day. After viewing the video presentations, participants are asked to summarize the main arguments in their own words by typing into a text box on their screen and then asked a series of questions to ensure comprehension. we will include analyses restricted based on comprehension as described below. The primes were randomly assigned within each session, with approximately 1/3 of participants in each condition. The setup of the lab included dividers between computers so that subjects were unaware of the images shown on the screens of others. Additionally, all subjects wore headphones, so they were unaware of what other participants were hearing. All images used in the implicit religiosity measure (described below) were vetted for comprehension by the experimenters and were further validated through debriefing after several pilot sessions.","1. Self-reported religiosity
Self-reported religiosity is one of our two main outcome variables of interest. Following Shariff, et al (2008), we ask a series of 6 questions intended to gauge religiosity. Individuals are asked to rate the extent they agree with each of the following statements on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5
(strongly agree):
 My personal religious beliefs are very important to me;
 My religion or faith is an important part of my identity;
 If someone wanted to understand who I am as a person, my religion or faith would be very important to that;
 I believe strongly in the teachings of my religion or faith;
 I believe in God;
 I consider myself a religious person

2. Implicit religiosity
Implicit religiosity is one of our two main outcome variables of interest. We employ a single-target Implicit Association Test (ST-IAT) adapted from (but not identical to) the design used by Shariff et al.(2008). The ST-IAT is a computer-based sorting task that uses response time to measure unconscious associations with a target concept. In each block of the ST-IAT, subjects sort three categories of words to the left- and right-hand sides of the screen: synonyms of ‚Äúreal‚Äù, synonyms of ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù, and words associated with religion. All language used in the task was vetted for comprehension with the sample population during several pilot sessions. In one block, the subjects sort the religious words and synonyms of ‚Äúreal‚Äù to the same side. In a second block, the subjects sort religious words and synonyms of ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù to the same side. The order in which these two blocks occur is randomized. The ST-IAT design assumes that subjects will more quickly sort target words to the side that represents their implicit association with the target. As a manipulation check for the ST-IAT, we also administer ST-IATs using alternatively the names of cartoon characters familiar to most Kenyans and the names of natural landmarks in Kenya. We hypothesize that individuals should be relatively faster to associate cartoons with the concept imaginary and faster to associate natural landmarks with the concept real.

3. Cantril Ladder
To assess how religion may influence an individual‚Äôs sense of status, we present participants with a Cantril ladder, which asks participants where they would rate their current life compared to the best possible life they can imagine for themselves, both now and in five years by indicating where they stand (will stand) on a picture of a ladder with steps labeled 0 to 10.

4. Tolerance
We adapt a series of questions from the World Values Survey asking participants ‚ÄúOf the following groups of people, which would you not like to have as neighbors?‚Äù
 Drug addicts
 People of a different race
 People who have AIDS
 Immigrants / foreign workers
 Homosexuals
 People of a different religion
 Atheists/people with no religion
 Heavy drinkers
 Unmarried couples living together
 People who speak a different language

5. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)
To assess the possible effect of the primes on affect, individuals complete questions from the PANAS evaluating negative affect after viewing the primes. On a scale of 1 (not at all) to 100 (very much), subjects are asked ‚ÄúHow much do you feel...‚Äù
 ‚ÄúDistressed, at this moment?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúUpset, at this moment?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGuilty, at this moment?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAshamed, at this moment?‚Äô
 ‚ÄúHostile, at this moment?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúIrritable, at this moment?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúNervous, at this moment?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúJittery, at this moment?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúScared, at this moment?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAfraid, at this moment?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúFrustrated, at this moment?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúStressed, at this moment?‚Äù

6. Demographics
We ask individuals to report their gender, age and religious affiliation.","Self-reported Religiosity:
We evaluate the impact of priming on each of the questions individually, and test for joint significance using Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR). In addition, we will analyze a weighted-average index based on the methodology in Anderson (2008). Finally, we will also examine impact of priming on any latent factors identified using factor analysis restricting the analysis to factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 and using a varimax rotation.

Implicit Religiosity: 
Using the result of the ST-IAT described above, for each individual we will calculate a D-score as the difference between the mean latency when associating the target concept with the concept ""real"" and the mean latency when associating the target concept with the concept ""imaginary"" divided by the pooled standard deviation. Latency (response time) is recorded in milliseconds and shorter latency indicates a stronger implicit association. A lower D-score represents a stronger belief in the validity of religious concepts. 

Following the recommendations in Greenwald, et al (2003), we will exclude participants for whom more than 10% of responses are below 300 ms, as well as all responses over 10,000 ms. Individuals who initially respond incorrectly in a trial are required to press the correct response before proceeding to the next trial. We measure latency as the total time from beginning the trial to the entry of a correct response, effectively penalizing incorrect responses with longer latencies (Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji 2003). To check the robustness of our results, we will also analyze the reports using the approach of Lowes et al. (2015). Instead of dropping responses over 10,000 ms, we will winsorize reponse times to 3,000 ms and replace response times for trials that were initially incorrect with the block mean response time plus the block standard deviation.

Cantril Ladder: We will calculate z-scores for responses to both the present-date and 5-year Cantril ladder question.

WVS Tolerance: We will analyze individual responses and test joint significant with SUR regression; in addition, we will calculate both aggregate and weighted average indexes across all responses.

PANAS: We will evaluate whether priming impacted affect by analyzing individual responses and testing for joint significance with SUR regression; in addition, we will analyze the summary indices of this measure. We will also use PANAS results as a dimension of heterogeneity.",,,"1.  Sampling
The study was conducted at the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics (Busara) in Nairobi, Kenya, a facility specially designed for social science studies. Busara maintains an active subject pool of more than 7,000 Nairobi residents. For the present study, 318 subjects who had previously signed-up to be part of the Busara subjet pool were recruited from local universities using SMS and phone calls and were informed that they would be paid KES 300 (approx. USD 7.20 PPP)1. Subjects were told that they were invited to participate in a study about their behavior and preferences. Recruitment was limited to university students to ensure comprehension of the arguments contained in primes. Restricting participation to University students also ensures comprehension English. Although Universities do not typically require an official test of English proficiency, matriculating students are expected to be proficient in written and spoken English, and much of the instruction is in English. Additionally, Busara has confirmed through previous studies that the vast majority of Kenyan university students are highly proficient in English. The sample includes 183 males and 133 females. All subjects were over 18 years of age, with a mean age of 22 and a maximum age of 26.

To control for heterogeneity in religious background, we restricted the sample to Christians by omitting individuals identified as ethnically Nubian from recruitment. Since most Muslims in the Busara subject pool belong to this ethnicity, we believed this to be the best way to identify Christians while avoiding any issues of self-selection that might arise by asking individuals their religion before participation. As described below, 24 individuals in the study either failed to report a religion identified as ‚Äúno religion‚Äù or identified as ‚Äúother,‚Äù and 2 individuals identified as Muslim. We will control for this fact by restricting our analysis as described below.

2. Experimental Procedure
After receiving a text message inviting them to participate in the study, individuals came to the Busara lab in Nairobi, Kenya, for experimental sessions lasting approximately one and half hours. Each session included up to 25 participants. Sessions were administered by two female Kenyan research assistants, who spoke English and Swahili fluently and were trained in helping subjects with comprehension. The experiment was conducted in English. 

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of 25 computer workstations with partitions on three sides, so that they were unable to see or speak with the other subjects. Within each session, individuals were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. All of the treatments and measures were implemented on HP TouchSmart 310 desktop computers running Windows 7. Each participant wore headphones and watched the video prime on his or her own computer. Subjects used the touch screen exclusively to mitigate effects of individual differences in experiences using a mouse and keyboard. All treatments were implemented using z-Tree software (Fischbacher 2007).

Respondents are given 5 minutes per scenario to contemplate about how they might deal with these problems. These scenarios, by touching on financial issues, act as primes that trigger thoughts of the respondent‚Äôs own economic situation.","

We construct a weighted asset ownership index following the procedure in Anderson (2008). In addition, we will run a basic treatment effects specification to capture the impact of treatment relative to control:

Ti is a treatment indicator that takes the value 1 for respondents that received the ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù financial scenario and 0 for those with the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù scenario.

weeks, and months afterward.  Canvassers were coached to be polite and respectful at all times, to listen attentively
to voters when discussing either same-sex marriage or recycling, and to refrain from arguing with
voters. The
same-sex marriage script invited voters to share their experiences with marriage. This script was the
same for gay and straight canvassers, with one important exception. After establishing rapport with
the voter, midway through the conversation, gay canvassers revealed that they are gay or lesbian and
that they would like to get married but that the law prohibits same-sex marriage. Straight canvassers
instead described how their child, friend, or relative would like to get married but that the law prohibits
same-sex marriage. Voters were asked to share their thoughts on this dilemma. These doorstep
conversations lasted on average 22 minutes.","Before canvassers went into the field, the study first gathered baseline
positions on a range of political attitudes for all participants using an ostensibly unrelated online
survey. The survey included 50 questions, as described in the Supplemental Online Materials (SOM).
The two questions concerning same-sex marriage and feelings about gay people were buried amid
a large number of items on unrelated topics so that respondents would not suspect any connection
between the survey and the canvassing visit. The panel survey included the two outcome measures in
every wave, but the overall content of the survey was kept fresh by randomly rotating new questions
in each wave. Another important feature of the design concerns blinding of canvassers and survey
respondents. Voters were unaware that the online survey was related to the canvassing effort, and
canvassers had no knowledge that voters were participants in an online survey. Finally, to prevent
housemates from completing each other‚Äôs surveys, extensive precautions were taken, including issuing distinct personal login instructions to take differently named surveys, tracking of distinct IP addresses
and session cookies, and sending invitations to take the survey during working hours (91% were in
fact completed at work), when housemates would be less likely to be together.","Survey Outcome Measures:

Contact with minorities coupled with discussion of issues pertinent to them is capable of producing a cascade of opinion change.

We address three main research questions:
RQ1: Does contacting guardians and encouraging them to improve their students‚Äô attendance reduce absences?
RQ2: Does communicating to guardians the total number of days their student missed reduce absences?
RQ3: Does communicating to guardians the total number of days their student missed as compared to the absences of a typical student reduce absences?

We also address the exploratory research question:
RQ4: Do these interventions also impact the attendance of other students in the household not explicitly mentioned in the mailings?

The three main research questions can be condensed into three behavioral-psychology-motivated components:
1. ENCOURAGE ‚Äì Reaching out to guardians and encouraging them to improve student attendance
2. SELF ‚Äì Informing guardians about their students‚Äô absences
3. NORMS ‚Äì Comparing students‚Äô absences to what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù

There is no way of testing the effectiveness of the NORMS component without also implicitly measuring the effectiveness of generic parental encouragement (i.e., ENCOURAGE) and giving guardians information about their students‚Äô attendance (i.e., SELF). As such, we leverage an experimental design that tests the added impact of each of these three components. Participating households are randomly assigned to one of four conditions:
(1) CONTROL: receives no additional outreach as part of this experiment.
(2) ENCOURAGE: receives mail stressing the importance of attendance, parental efficacy, and absence-reduction as part of parental role.
(3) ENCOURAGE + SELF: receives mail that has the same content as the ENCOURAGE mail but also states the number of days of school the guardians‚Äô student missed.
(4) ENCOURAGE + SELF +NORMS: receives mail that contains all the same information as the ENCOURAGE + SELF mail but also compares the student‚Äôs attendance record to that of the typical student in their school and grade.","See memo

7,The effect of affordable daycare on health and economic well-being over the life course in India: A cluster-randomized impact evaluation study,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/774,12/9/20,12/9/20 13:43,7/15/15,AEARCTR-0000774,10.1257/rct.774-3.1,Sam Harper sam.harper@mcgill.ca,completed,10/1/14,3/1/18,"[""education"", ""health"", ""labor"", ""daycare"", ""economic opportunity"", ""employment"", ""income"", ""women's empowerment"", ""health"", ""depression"", ""nutrition"", ""time use""]",India (Rajasthan),Arijit Nandi (arijit.nandi@mcgill.ca) McGill University; Parul Agarwal (parul.agarwal@ifmr.ac.in)  Institute for Financial Management and Research; Shannon Maloney (shannon.maloney@ifmr.ac.in)  Institute for Financial Management and Research,,,"There are structural barriers to women's economic participation and empowerment in India. Among these barriers is the lack of affordable and reliable daycare services. The responsibility of providing childcare is imposed primarily on women and contributes to gender inequalities experienced by women over the life-course. The provision of affordable and reliable daycare services is a potentially important policy lever for reducing gender inequality and improving health and socioeconomic well-being over the life-course. Access to daycare might reduce barriers to labor force entry and generate economic opportunities for women, improve education for girls caring for younger siblings, and promote nutrition and learning among children. However, empirical evidence concerning the effects of daycare programs over the life-course in low-and-middle-income countries is scarce. We propose a cluster-randomized impact evaluation for estimating the effect of a community-based daycare program on health and economic well-being over the life-course among women and children living in rural Rajasthan, India. This interdisciplinary research initiative will address an important research gap and has the potential to inform policies for improving the daycare system in India in ways that promote inclusive economic growth.",,,,8/1/15,3/1/18,"The proposed intervention is the introduction of full time, affordable daycare centers, or balwadis, that will be implemented by Seva Mandir, in 80 hamlets in the Udaipur district of Rajasthan. These hamlets will serve as the treatment group for the randomized control trial. Each of the balwadis will provide childcare, nutritious food and supplements, basic medicines, and preschool education to children 1-6 years old. Balwadis are operated by local women, called Sanchalikas, who meet with mothers on a quarterly basis to discuss their child's progress. They also promote immunization of children by maintaining immunization records and following-up with parents and government nurses. 

In December 2014 and early January 2015, potential study hamlets were selected. These hamlets were selected from areas where Seva Mandir works and operates programs besides the balwadi program. We identified 160 eligible hamlets that satisfied five criteria, specifically: (1) no readily accessible balwadi or government-run aganwadi nearby (within 1.5 kilometers) to reduce the potential for contamination effects; (2) minimum number of children in the appropriate age range (>24) in the village to ensure adequate demand; (3) existing building suitable for a balwadi; (4) a qualified Sanchalika, living in the study hamlet or nearby, to operate the balwadi; and (5) adequate demand from the village council (Panchayat) for a new balwadi, as expressed by an application for a balwadi. Seva Mandir provided a listing of 160 hamlets that satisfied these criteria to the study investigators, after which a household census was conducted in each hamlet to confirm the eligibility of the hamlet, enumerate the population, and identify potential households for inclusion.

In January 2015, we conducted a household census in each of the 160 hamlets to confirm the eligibility of the hamlet, enumerate the population, and identify potential respondents for inclusion. Eligible respondents were mothers (biological or guardian) with a child between one and six years of age. The total number of eligible respondents was similar to our desired sample size. Therefore, we did not probabilistically sample individuals among eligible respondents and all eligible respondents were selected for interview.

Within each eligible household, a woman with a child less than 6 years old was randomly selected as the primary respondent using a Kish procedure. Outcomes will be measured via in-person survey at baseline, just before the balwadis are introduced, at midline, approximately halfway through the intervention period, and at endline, approximately 18-24 months post the start of the intervention.","We will measure the impact of our intervention on self-reported empowerment (self-esteem, role in decision-making, freedom of mobility, and control of material resources), measured via in-person survey. Other outcomes include labor market attachment (employment status, occupation, hours worked), economic status (personal and household income), time use, and mental health (depressive symptoms). Additionally, we will measure nutritional status (stunting, wasting, underweight) among children less than six years of age, as well as educational attainment and literacy among school-aged children.","Regarding the measurement of empowerment, we adopted the conceptual approach of Kabeer, which incorporates both the personal and political dimensions of empowerment, and developed indicators that captured ""women's sense of self‚Äêworth and identity, their willingness to question their own subordinate status, their control over their own lives and their voice and influence within the family"". We constructed indicators of empowerment, adapted from the Indian NFHS4 whenever possible to facilitate comparability, which encompassed four domains: (1) decision making within the family and control over income (e.g., Who decides how the money you earn will be used: mainly you, mainly your husband, or you and your husband jointly?); (2) freedom of movement in the public domain (e.g., Are you usually permitted to go to the following places on your own, only if someone accompanies you, or not at all?); (3) participation in community and public life (e.g., Are you a member of any type of association, group or club which holds regular meetings?); (4) and views and attitudes on critical gender issues (e.g., Please tell me if you agree or disagree with each statement: A married woman should be allowed to work outside the home if she wants to). We tested the face validity of the questionnaire by consulting individuals with local expertise and added, deleted, and revised existing indicators. We pilot tested the questionnaire in sample of approximately 200 women. The questionnaire was modified accordingly based on the results of the pilot study. A data reduction technique (i.e., factor analysis) will be used to provide a summary score. We plan to test the reliability of empowerment measures during the second survey wave. 

Use of time was measured using a structured questionnaire, adapted from a study by Beaman et al. (2012), that asked respondents whether they spent any time in the past 24 hours on specific activities (e.g., gathering fuel or firewood), how much time they spent on each activity, and whether this amount reflected the usual amount of time spent on the activity. The questionnaire also asks whether respondents were paid in cash or in-kind for the activities they engaged in.

The survey asks about employment experiences, including whether respondents work, their occupation, the type of work, the quantity of work, whether they are paid for their work in cash or in-kind, and what they do with their children while working. We will ask about household income received in the past 12 months from various categories (e.g., agricultural income, business income, rents, remittances, government payments). Household wealth will be measured using a series of questions about ownership of specific assets (e.g., telephone, bicycle, radio), environmental conditions (e.g., type of water source, sanitation facilities), and housing characteristics, (e.g., number of rooms, materials used for housing construction). Additionally, we will ask respondents about savings accounts held by household members, including for each account the type of account, its purpose, the total value, and whether the respondent can use the account to make purchases. 

With respect to anthropometry, the equipment used will be calibrated daily before home or hospital visits. Two anthropometrists will record data independently and compare values. The average of these two values is taken, and any large discrepancies can be resolved by a first repeat measurement. Length is measured using a length board (sometimes called an infantometer) placed on a flat, stable surface such as a table. To measure height, a height board (sometimes called a stadiometer) will be mounted at a right angle between a level floor and against a straight, vertical surface such as a wall or pillar. If a child is less than 2 years old (or if age is unknown, less than 85 cm), recumbent length will be measured. If the child is aged 2 years or older (or if age is unknown, greater than 85 cm) and able to stand, standing height will be measured. The child's shoes, socks, and hair ornaments will be removed. Braids will be undone if they will interfere with the measurement of length/height. The Shorr height board is will be used to measure recumbent length. Adult and child heights will be measured using the Harpenden Portable Stadiometer (range 65-206 cm). For weight measurement tared weighing will be performed for children less than 2 years old. If the child is 2 years or older the will be weighed alone (if the child can stand still). The SECA 814 digital scale (up to 200kg) will be used to measure child weight. To measure arm circumference, any clothing covering the child's arms will be removed. The midpoint of the child's upper left arm will be calculated and marked with pen on the child‚Äôs arm. The child's arm will be straightened and the tape used to measure the circumference. While measuring, the tape should be flat on the child's arm. The measurement should be recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. Circumferences will be measured using a metal tape (range 0-200 cm). The suggested instrument for measuring mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is the MUAC Tape (UNICEF Item No. 145600 Arm circumference insertion tape/pack of 50). ",,,"The intervention, i.e. the introduction of balwadis, will be randomly assigned to 80 of the 160 hamlets. The remaining 80 hamlets will serve as comparison group. The survey, which measures the study outcomes, will be administered at the baseline (before the intervention starts), at the mid-line (one year after the intervention starts), and at the end-line (when the intervention/program ends). ",,Randomization was done in office by a computer (using Stata software's random number generator),"We randomly assigned the 160 hamlets to treatment or control stratified by block (Badgaon, Girwa, Jhadol, Herwara, Kotra) because we wanted to prevent random variations in the distributions of blocks across treatment groups from confounding effects (e.g., if women in treated hamlets were more likely to reside in blocks with more economic opportunities). A random integer was assigned to each of the five blocks and each of the 160 hamlets using a random number generator.",160 village hamlets,3200 individuals,80 treated hamlets; 80 control hamlets,"In the context of clustered treatment assignment the minimum detectable effect (MDE, Bloom 1984) will vary as a function of the extent of clustering. We calculated a range of MDEs under different clustering scenarios for our primary binary outcome, labor force participation, conditional on the number of clusters (j) the number of subjects per cluster (n) and the degree of clustering (estimated by the intra-cluster correlation coefficient [ICC]). We focus on estimating the MDE for a pre-specified level of power, based on our initial design of j=160 clusters (80 treated, 80 comparison) and n=20 subjects per cluster. 

Plugging in values for type II error (kappa=0.20), type I error (alpha=0.05), a balanced 50% allocation fraction (P=0.5), the standard deviation of the outcome in the control population (labour force participation rate of 30%, so SD=.3*(1-.3)=.21), and sample size (N=3200), this gives a MDE of 0.03, meaning that we could detect a treatment effect as small as 3 percentage points (33% or 27% in the treated vs. 30% in the control).

Cluster randomization will increase the MDE because it reduces precision, and this is a function of the degree of clustering, as measured by the intra-cluster correlation (ICC). Effectively, this deflates the precision so we will either need to be satisfied with a larger MDE or a bigger sample to estimate the same MDE. If we revise the scenario above to take into account the clustered design, fixing the clusters again to 80 treated and 80 untreated, increasing the ICC increases the MDE.

For k=160 clusters and n=20 individuals per cluster, the MDE for various ICCs are calculated as:

ICC=0.00, MDE=0.05
ICC=0.05, MDE=0.07
ICC=0.10, MDE=0.08
ICC=0.20, MDE=0.10

For degrees of clustering typical in social science surveys (between 0.01 and 0.05, Bloom 2005), the present design of 160 clusters and 20 individuals per cluster still provides us with MDEs that seem feasible and relevant (5 to 7 percentage point differences for binary outcomes with baseline proportions of around 0.3).

Motivated by insights from behavioral economics, the study tests if behavioral responses vary depending on whether subjects are led to label and create ‚Äòmental savings accounts‚Äô in private or public ways. Individuals in the private-labeling treatment groups were led to label their savings as earmarked for a particular purpose and to state savings accumulation targets, information which was shared only privately with a member of the research team. Individuals in the public-labeling treatment groups received the same intervention but were then asked to reveal publicly and announce their chosen goals to other members of their savings group. The average treatment effects of the public-labeling intervention are very strong and significant. Savings accumulations increased by an average of 35% and savings goals were 8.5% more likely to be reached in comparison to the untreated group. Further results strongly suggest evidence of differentiated behavioral responses of individuals in the private-labeling treatment group: private commitment to a savings goal is more effective for individuals who, after random assignment but prior to the intervention, had been measured to be less constrained by economic circumstances and institutional barriers. ",,,,8/15/11,11/30/11,"The RCT randomly assigned 137 newly formed Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLA), mainly in rural areas from nine municipalities of Colombia into two treatments and a control group. Individuals in the control group were exposed to the standard VSLA model.  In the private-labeling treatment members received an additional module with a short organized guided conversation aimed at discussing and highlighting the difficulties of committing to a savings path and the potential role and use of mental accounts in strengthening those commitments. I asked participants to voluntarily state in writing a savings purpose and weekly savings goals. This was intended to help guide individuals to form and label their mental ‚Äòsavings‚Äô account to privately commit to achieving that savings purpose. Goals were not stated publicly. The public-labeling treatment was similar except that the group discussion encouraged members to make commitments to themselves as well as to others in their group in order to explore the possibility that this might lead to different outcomes. As in the private-labeling treatment members were asked to voluntarily state a savings purpose and weekly savings goals in writing, but in this intervention, those commitments were shared with all members of the group. By doing this, individuals explicitly label their ‚Äòmental savings account‚Äô and publicly commit to their own decision. Individuals were not informed about the (public) nature of the treatment prior to the public announcement.  This module included a trust building game and a guided conversation aimed at highlighting the achievements of group commitments.

For example, if 5 new VSLA were formed in a week in Cartagena, I draw the type of intervention that the VSLA would be assigned to (private, public or control).

9,Motivating cord blood donations,https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/695,1/30/17,1/30/17 11:09,4/15/15,AEARCTR-0000695,10.1257/rct.695-3.0,Nicola Lacetera nicola.lacetera@utoronto.ca,completed,11/1/14,7/31/16,"[""health""]",Italy (),Mario Macis (mmacis@jhu.edu) Johns Hopkins University; Daniela Grieco () ,,,"Umbilical cord blood is a key source of hematopoietic stem cells for patients who face life-threatening diseases and need transplants from unrelated donors. However, only a very small share of parents opts for donating the cord blood upon the birth of their children. Why are donation rates so low and what can be done to increase them? How can conceptual and methodological perspectives from the social sciences provide helpful insights? 
We implement a natural field experiment in collaboration with an OB-GYN clinic. We are interested, in particular, in the effect of providing information about an activity that might not be known by most expectant parents, and in the effect of the timing at which information, as well as the request of interest to donate, is provided to these prospective parents. For example, if someone is asked early in the pregnancy, the temporal distance from the actual event might lead to both cognitive and emotional distance, such that individuals might not fully appreciate the value of their choice. Conversely, issues such as self-control may be relevant; at a certain point during the pregnancy, parents may agree on donating the cord blood upon delivery, but they might change their mind or simply overlook this issue as delivery comes close. In a condition of informational and emotional overload, the salience of this issue may also play a relevant role.
Hundreds of pregnant women visiting the clinic will be randomly assigned to the following experimental conditions: (1) the provision of information about the importance of donating cord blood; (2) the possibility for the subjects to express the (non-binding) will to donate upon delivery; and (3) reminders about the subjects‚Äô reported intention to donate or not. Treatment groups (1) and (2) will be split in two, and subjects in each half will be treated at one of two stages of the pregnancy. The main outcome of interest is the decision on how to use the cord blood upon delivery (including the self-storage decision). We will also have access to hospital data, which will include demographics, basic health information about the subjects, and information about their pregnancy. In addition to the hospital data, information on the subjects will be obtained from a questionnaire administered at baseline, i.e., at the subjects‚Äô first visit in their pregnancy. The main goal of the baseline survey is to obtain socio-economic information about the subjects which is not available in hospital records, such as education, occupation, and family structure. The survey will also contain items aimed at eliciting risk preferences.
The proposed study will contribute to the literature on the motivations for altruistic behavior, by providing evidence on a specific activity that has been seldom considered in the social sciences, and by devising new mechanisms to increase donations. Some of the mechanisms that we propose build on the research on the power of ‚Äúsoft commitments‚Äù as well as on the effect of reminders and ‚Äúmultiple asking‚Äù. A particular feature of this setting is that the analyzed decision includes, in addition to the non-use, both an altruistic option (donate to a public bank) and a ‚Äúselfish‚Äù option (self-storage), unlike other comparable contexts such as blood or organ donations where this three-way choice set is not present. The findings will inform the scholarly debate but also be of primary relevance for organizations engaged in enhancing donations (in particular, public cord blood bank that are growing in several countries), and for policymakers.",,,,11/1/14,5/31/16,"About 1,800 pregnant women visiting the OB-GYN clinic are randomly assigned to the following conditions:

T0: Control. Subjects in this group do not receive any additional information other than what the hospitals regularly provide to expecting parents. 
T1: Information ‚Äì first trimester. Subjects in this group who visit the clinic in the first trimester of the pregnancy are provided with a two-page document containing information about the importance of donating cord blood and its current and potential future uses.
T2: Prompted choice ‚Äì first trimester. Subjects in this group who visit the clinic in the first trimester of the pregnancy, in addition to being given the same information as in T1 are also asked to state their (non-binding) intention to donate cord blood or not upon delivery. The subjects who express their intention to donate the cord blood will then be provided with the required forms to fill and submit to the hospital at their convenience. Thus the subjects are not required to fill these forms and submit them ‚Äúon the spot‚Äù; they are simply given the forms.
T3: Information ‚Äì third trimester. Same as T1, but information is provided during the third trimester of the pregnancy.
T4: Prompted choice ‚Äì week 30. Same as T2, but information and request of interest are administered during the third trimester of the pregnancy.
T5: Prompted choice in first trimester, reminder and ‚Äúsecond chance‚Äù in third trimester. Subjects in this group are treated as in T2 in the first trimester. In addition, during a visit in the third trimester they are given the opportunity to revise their choice. 

Women in all conditions are administered the same baseline questionnaire including demographic questions as well as questions about risk attitudes, knowledge of medical issues, as well as the possibility to participate to a lottery and to donate part of the potential prize to charity, as a way to measure altruism.
","The main outcomes of interest are the response to the prompted choice questions (for women in T2, T4 and T5), whether women fill in and hand in the forms for the donation consent, and whether a donation actually occurred at delivery.
